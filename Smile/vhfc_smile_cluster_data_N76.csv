1,0,2,A crowdsourcing toolbox for a user-perception based design of social virtual actors,"Ochs, M.; Ravenet, B.; Pelachaud, C.","One of the key challenges in the development of social virtual actors is to give them the capability to display socio-emotional states through their non-verbal behavior. Based on studies in human and social sciences or on annotated corpora of human expressions, different models to synthesize virtual agent's non-verbal behavior have been developed. One of the major issues in the synthesis of behavior using a corpus-based approach is collecting datasets, which can be difficult, time consuming and expensive to collect and annotate. A growing interest in using crowdsourcing to collect and annotate datasets has been observed in recent years. In this paper, we have implemented a toolbox to easily develop online crowdsourcing tools to build a corpus of virtual agent's non-verbal behaviors diffectly rated by users. We present two developed online crowdsourcing tools that have been used to construct a repertoire of virtual smiles and to define virtual agents' non-verbal behaviors associated to social attitudes.

2,0,7,A user perception-based approach to create smiling embodied conversational agents,"Ochs, M.; Pelachaud, C.; McKeown, G.","In order to improve the social capabilities of embodied conversational agents, we propose a computational model to enable agents to automatically select and display appropriate smiling behavior during human-machine interaction. A smile may convey different communicative intentions depending on subtle characteristics of the facial expression and contextual cues. To construct such a model, as a first step, we explore the morphological and dynamic characteristics of different types of smiles (polite, amused, and embarrassed smiles) that an embodied conversational agent may display. The resulting lexicon of smiles is based on a corpus of virtual agents' smiles directly created by users and analyzed through a machine-learning technique. Moreover, during an interaction, a smiling expression impacts on the observer's perception of the interpersonal stance of the speaker. As a second step, we propose a probabilistic model to automatically compute the user's potential perception of the embodied conversational agent's social stance depending on its smiling behavior and on its physical appearance. This model, based on a corpus of users' perceptions of smiling and nonsmiling virtual agents, enables a virtual agent to determine the appropriate smiling behavior to adopt given the interpersonal stance it wants to express.

3,0,20,Effect of a virtual agents contingent smile response on perceived social status,"Saberi, M.; Bernardet, U.; Di Paola, S.","We are investigating if an agents contingent smile during an interaction with a human participant affects the impression of the virtual characters social status. Psychological studies show lower status individuals are more likely to show contingent feedback [4]. A ""Rock-Paper-Scissors"" game is used as the scenario to provide an infrastructure for an interaction between a 3D agent and a human participant. During the interaction we are using electromyographic measurements to determine when the human participant is smiling. Immediately after a detected smiling the virtual character mimics the smile. More specifically, we are expecting that participants form the impression that the character has a low social status when the agent shows contingent smiling behavior. We are currently performing the experiment and a next step is to evaluate the system by analyzing the results.

4,0,32,From emotions to interpersonal stances: Multi-level analysis of smiling virtual characters,"Ochs, M.; Prepin, K.; Pelachaud, C.","In this paper, we explore the emotions and interpersonal stances that the expressions of smile may convey by analyzing the user's perception of smiling embodied conversational agents at different levels: (1) a signal level considering the emotions and stances that a signal of smile may convey depending on its morphological and dynamic characteristics, (2) a communicative level by exploring the effects of the ECA's smiling behavior on the stances perceived by a user, and (3) an interactive level by showing the influence of the alignment of smiles in a dyad of virtual characters on the perceived stances. In the light of this multi-level analysis of smiles, we propose the architecture of a fully interactive smiling ECA based on an extension of the SAIBA framework.  2013

5,0,36,How a virtual agent should smile? Morphological and dynamic chacteristics of virtual agent's smiles,"Ochs, M.; Niewiadomski, R.; Pelachaud, C.","A smile may communicate different meanings depending on subtle characteristics of the facial expression. In this article, we have studied the morphological and dynamic characteristics of amused, polite, and embarrassed smiles displayed by a virtual agent. A web application has been developed to collect virtual agent's smile descriptions corpus directly constructed by users. Based on the corpora and using a decision tree classification technique, we propose an algorithm to determine the characteristics of each type of the smile that a virtual agent may express.

6,0,45,Model of the perception of smiling virtual character,"Ochs, M.; Pelachaud, C.","A smile may convey different communicative intentions depending on subtle characteristics of the facial expression. Moreover, during an interaction, the expression of smile impacts on the observer's perception of both the social stance of the speaker and of the content of the talk. In this paper, we describe a perceptual study where we explore the effects of virtual characters displaying different types of smiles (namely politeness and amusement) when speaking on the user's perception. Based on the collected data, a model to automatically compute the user's potential perception of the virtual character's social stance depending on its smiling behavior and on its gender has been proposed.

7,0,46,Mutual stance building in dyad of virtual agents: Smile alignment and synchronisation,"Prepin, K.; Ochs, M.; Pelachaud, C.","When we consider communication, the 'interactivenature of dialog supports interactive alignment of linguisticrepresentations' [1]. However, verbal communication cannot be reduced to speech. Non-verbal behaviours (NVBs) of interactantsare also taking part in interactive alignment. Based on NVBs alignment, this paper proposes a model of mutual building of stance between virtual agents. In this model, we focus on the the social signal of smile. Indeed, smiles are particular non-verbal markers of agents' stances: their characteristics in terms of facial and dynamical patterns leads to discriminate stances as for instance politeness or amusement. We propose a model combining alignment of types of smile and alignement of timing of smiles (synchronisation).

8,0,53,Smile and the world will smile with you-The effects of a virtual agent's smile on users' evaluation and behavior,"Krämer, N.C.; Kopp, S.; Becker-Asano, C.; Sommer, N.","Recent studies have demonstrated that people show social reactions when interacting with human-like virtual agents. For instance, human users behave in a socially desirable way, show increased cooperation or apply human-like communication. It has, however, so far not been tested whether users are prone to mimic the artificial agent's behavior although this is a widely cited phenomenon of human human communication that seems to be especially indicative of the sociality of the situation. We therefore conducted an experiment, in which we analyzed whether humans reciprocate an agent's smile. In a between-subjects design, 104 participants conducted an 8-min small-talk conversation with an agent that either did not smile, showed occasional smiles, or displayed frequent smiles. Results show that although smiling did not have a distinct impact on the evaluation of the agent, the human interaction partners themselves smiled longer when the agent was smiling.

9,0,54,Smiling virtual agent in social context.,"Ochs, M.; Niewiadomski, R.; Brunet, P.; Pelachaud, C.","A smile may communicate different communicative intentions depending on subtle characteristics of the facial expression. In this article, we propose an algorithm to determine the morphological and dynamic characteristics of virtual agent's smiles of amusement, politeness, and embarrassment. The algorithm has been defined based on a virtual agent's smiles corpus constructed by users and analyzed with a decision tree classification technique.

10,0,58,Social stances by virtual smiles,"Ochs, M.; Pelachaud, C.; Prepin, K.","When two persons participate to a discussion, they not only exchange about the concepts and ideas they are dis-cussing, but they also express stances with regard to content of their speech (called epistemic stances) and to convey their interpersonal relationship (called interpersonal stances). The stances can be expressed through non-verbal behaviors, for instance smiles. Stances are also co-constructed by their interactants through simultaneous or sequential behaviors such as the alignment of speaker's and listener's smiles. In this paper, we present several studies exploring the stances (epistemic, interpersonal, and co-constructed) that the social signal of smile may convey. We propose to analyze different contextual levels to highlight how users' engagement and discourse context influence their perception of the virtual characters' stances. © 2013 IEEE.",2013,"2013 14th

11,0,66,The Effects of a Pedagogical Agent's Smiling Expression on the Learner's Emotions and Motivation in a Virtual Learning Environment,"Liew, T.W.; Zin, N.A.M.; Sahari, N.; Tan, S.M.","The present study aimed to test the hypothesis that a smiling expression on the face of a talking pedagogical agent could positively affect a learner's emotions, motivation, and learning outcomes in a virtual learning environment. Contrary to the hypothesis, results from Experiment 1 demonstrated that the pedagogical agent's smile induced negative emotional and motivational responses in learners. Experiment 2 showed that the social meaning of a pedagogical agent's smile might be perceived by learners as polite or fake. In addition, qualitative data provided insights into factors that may cause negative perceptions of a pedagogical agent's smile, which in turn lead to negative affective (emotional and motivational) states in learners.

12,0,74,"Towards a smiling ECA: Studies on mimicry, timing and types of smiles","Niewiadomski, R.; Prepin, K.; Bevacqua, E.; Ochs, M.; Pelachaud, C.","Smile is one of the most often used nonverbal signals. Depending on when, how and where it is displayed, it may convey various meanings. We believe that introducing the variety of smiles may improve the communicative skills of embodied conversational agents. In this paper we present on-going research on the role of smile in embodied conversational agents. In particular, we analyze the significance of smiling while the agent is either speaking or listening.

13,1,6,A study on feature sets for emotion recognition from speech signals,"Ko, Y.-C.","This thesis focuses on finding useful features for emotion recognition from speech signals. In comparison to the popular openSMILE 'emobase' feature set, our proposed method reduced the size of feature space to about 28% yet boosted the recognition rate by 3.3%.    Given we are at a point technologically where computing is cheap and fast, and lots of data are available, the approach to solving all sorts of problems is based on sophisticated machine learning techniques to implicitly make sense of data. Yet in this work, we study particular features that are felt to correlate with changes in emotion but have not been commonly selected for emotion recognition tasks. Jitter, shimmer, breathiness, and speaking rate are analyzed and are found to systematically change as a function of emotion.    We not only explore these additional acoustic features that help improve the classification performance, but also try to understand the importance of the existing features in improving accuracy.

14,1,56,Social signal processing: Survey of an emerging domain,"Vinciarelli, A.; Pantic, M.; Bourlard, H.","The ability to understand and manage social signals of a person we are communicating with is the core of social intelligence. Social intelligence is a facet of human intelligence that has been argued to be indispensable and perhaps the most important for success in life. This paper argues that next-generation computing needs to include the essence of social intelligence – the ability to recognize human social signals and social behaviours like turn taking, politeness, and disagreement – in order to become more effective and more efficient. Although each one of us understands the importance of social signals in everyday life situations, and in spite of recent advances in machine analysis of relevant behavioural cues like blinks, smiles, crossed arms, laughter, and similar, design and development of automated systems for social signal processing (SSP) are rather difficult.

15,1,61,String-based audiovisual fusion of behavioural events for the assessment of dimensional affect,"Eyben, F.; Wöllmer, M.; Valstar, M.F.; Gunes, H.; Schuller, B.; Pantic, M.","The automatic assessment of affect is mostly based on feature-level approaches, such as distances between facial points or prosodic and spectral information when it comes to audiovisual analysis. However, it is known and intuitive that behavioural events such as smiles, head shakes or laughter and sighs also bear highly relevant information regarding a subject's affective display. Accordingly, we propose a novel string-based prediction approach to fuse such events and to predict human affect in a continuous dimensional space. Extensive analysis and evaluation has been conducted using the newly released SEMAINE database of human-to-agent communication. For a thorough understanding of the obtained results, we provide additional benchmarks by more conventional feature-level modelling, and compare these and the string-based approach to fusion of signal-based features and string-based events. Our experimental results show that the proposed string-based approach is the best performing approach for automatic prediction of Valence and Expectation dimensions, and improves prediction

16,1,65,Temporal Association Rules for Modelling Multimodal Social Signals,"Janssoone, T.","In this paper, we present the first step of a methodology dedicated to deduce automatically sequences of signals expressed by humans during an interaction. The aim is to link interpersonal stances with arrangements of social signals such as modulations of Action Units and prosody during a face-to-face exchange. The long-term goal is to infer association rules of signals. We plan to use them as an input to the animation of an Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA). In this paper, we illustrate the proposed methodology to the SEMAINE-DB corpus from which we automatically extracted Action Units (AUs), head positions, turn-taking and prosody information. We have applied the data mining algorithm that is used to find the sequences of social signals featuring different social stances.

17,2,8,Achieving affective human–virtual agent communication by enabling virtual agents to imitate positive expressions,Numata T.; Sato H.; Asa Y.; Koike T.; Miyata K.; Nakagawa E.; Sumiya M.; Sadato N.,"Affective communication, communicating with emotion, during face-to-face communication is critical for social interaction. Advances in artificial intelligence have made it essential to develop affective human–virtual agent communication. A person’s belief during human–virtual agent interaction that the agent is a computer program affects social-cognitive processes. Whether this belief interferes with affective communication is an open question. We hypothesized that the imitation of a positive emotional expression by a virtual agent induces a positive emotion, regardless of the belief. To test this hypothesis, we conducted an fMRI study with 39 healthy volunteers, who were made to believe that a virtual agent was either a person or a computer. They were instructed to smile, and immediately afterwards, the virtual agent displayed a positive, negative, or neutral expression. The participants reported a positive emotion only when their smile was imitated by the agent’s positive expression regardless of their belief. This imitation activated the participants’ medial prefrontal cortex and precuneus, which are involved in anthropomorphism and contingency, respectively. These results suggest that a positive congruent response by a virtual agent can overcome the effect of believing that the agent is a computer program and thus contribute to achieving affective

18,2,13,Comprehension and engagement in survey interviews with virtual agents,"Conrad, F.G.; Schober, M.F.; Jans, M.; Orlowski, R.A.; Nielsen, D.; Levenstein, R.","This study investigates how an onscreen virtual agent's dialog capability and facial animation affect survey respondents' comprehension and engagement in ""face-to-face"" interviews, using questions from US government surveys whose results have far-reaching impact on national policies. In the study, 73 laboratory participants were randomly assigned to respond in one of four interviewing conditions, in which the virtual agent had either high or low dialog capability (implemented through Wizard of Oz) and high or low facial animation, based on motion capture from a human interviewer. Respondents, whose faces were visible to the Wizard (and videorecorded) during the interviews, answered 12 questions about housing, employment, and purchases on the basis of fictional scenarios designed to allow measurement of comprehension accuracy, defined as the fit between responses and US government definitions. Respondents answered more accurately with the high-dialog-capability agents, requesting clarification more often particularly for ambiguous scenarios; and they generally treated the high-dialog-capability interviewers more socially, looking at the interviewer more and judging high-dialog-capability agents as more personal and less distant. Greater interviewer facial animation did not affect response accuracy, but it led to more displays of engagement-acknowledgments (verbal and visual) and smiles-and to the virtual interviewer's being rated as less natural. The pattern of results suggests that a virtual agent's dialog capability and facial animation differently affect survey respondents' experience of interviews, behavioral displays, and comprehension, and thus the accuracy of their responses. The pattern of results also suggests design considerations for building survey interviewing agents, which may differ depending on the kinds of survey questions (sensitive or not) that are asked. © 2015 Conrad, Schober, Jans, Orlowski, Nielsen and Levenstein.",2015,Front.

19,2,15,Computers to help with conversations: Affective framework to enhance human nonverbal skills,"Hoque, M.E.","Nonverbal behavior plays an integral part in a majority of social interaction scenarios. Being able to adjust nonverbal behavior and influence other's responses are considered valuable social skills. A deficiency in nonverbal behavior can have detrimental consequences in personal as well as in professional life. Many people desire help, but due to limited resources, logistics, and social stigma, they are unable to get the training that they require. Therefore, there is a need for developing automated interventions to enhance human nonverbal behaviors that are standardized, objective, repeatable, low-cost, and can be deployed outside of the clinic. In this thesis, I design and validate a computational framework designed to enhance human nonverbal behavior. As part of the framework, I developed My Automated Conversation coacH (MACH)—a novel system that provides ubiquitous access to social skills training. The system includes a virtual agent that reads facial expressions, speech, and prosody, and responds with verbal and nonverbal behaviors in real-time. As part of explorations on nonverbal behavior sensing, I present results on understanding the underlying meaning behind smiles elicited under frustration, delight or politeness. I demonstrate that it is useful to model the dynamic properties of smiles that evolve through time and that while a smile may occur in positive and in negative situations, its underlying temporal structures may help to disambiguate the underlying state, in some cases, better than humans. I demonstrate how the new insights and developed technology from this thesis became part of a real-time system that is able to provide visual feedback to the participants on their nonverbal behavior. In particular, the system is able to provide summary feedback on smile tracks, pauses, speaking rate, fillers and intonation. It is also able to provide focused feedback on volume modulation and enunciation, head gestures, and smiles for the entire interaction. Users are able to practice as many times as they wish and compare their data across sessions. I validate the MACH framework in the context of job interviews with 90 MIT undergraduate students. The findings indicate that MIT students using MACH are perceived as stronger candidates compared to the students in the control group. The results were reported based on the judgments of the independent MIT career counselors and Mechanical Turkers', who did not participate in the study, and were blind to the study conditions.

20,2,16,Could a virtual agent bewarm and competent? Investigating user's impressions of agent's non-verbal behaviours,"Biancardi, B.; Cafaro, A.; Pelachaud, C.","In this abstract we introduce the design of an experiment aimed at investigating how users' impressions of an embodied conversational agent are influenced by agent's non-verbal behaviour. We focus on impressions of warmth and competence, the two fundamental dimensions of social perception. Agent's gestures, arms rest poses and smile frequency are manipulated, as well as users' expectations about agent's competence.We hypothesize that user's judgments will differ according to his expectations, by following the Expectancy Violation Theory proposed by Burgoon and colleagues. We also hypothesize to replicate the results found in our previous study concerning human-human interaction, for example high frequency of smiles will elicit higher warmth and lower competence

21,2,27,Feedback Strategies on Verbal and Nonverbal Cues to Improve Communication Skills,"Ali, M.R.","In this thesis, we present findings on designing and validating real-time and post feedback on nonverbal skills in face to face communication skills with a humanoid agent. The technical challenges included a real-time machine learning framework that can automatically process the audio-video data via a webcam, allowing the users to converse in natural language and receive live and post feedback on smile intensity, volume modulation, pauses, synchronicity, body language, eye-contact, sentiment and turn-taking.Our initial exploration included designing a wizard-of-oz experiment validating the form factors (i.e., flashing icons using the traffic light analogy) for real-time feedback using 46 college students. Using the data, we trained a hidden Markov model to generate feedback. The feedback on verbal cue was generated by performing sentiment and word category analysis. For post feedback, we summarized the nonverbal feedback using the support vector machine.The technical contributions were validated in three unique contexts: 1) helping individuals with autism; 2) helping elderly with their social skills; 3) helping physicians improve their interactions skills with patients.Applications to speed-dating and autism: In a randomized control study with 47 college students, we found that the feedback helped improve eye contact and gesture. In a preliminary study with nine teenagers with autism, we identified several design guidelines which include, briefing the users, making positive acknowledgments, and personalizing dialogue.Applications to aging: In a pilot study with 25 older adults, participants found the feedback useful and were able to reflect on the feedback. In a subsequent longitudinal study with 18 older adults, participants improved their eye contact and smiling.Applications to patient-physician communication: In the context of patient-physician communication, we conducted a study with eight clinicians where they found the feedback intuitive and easy to follow. Additionally, we identified two communication behaviors of physicians that help improve patients' prognosis understanding – 1) lecturing style of a conversational structure by maximizing entropy, and 2) the positive language patterns (i.e., sentiment trajectory) using k-means clustering. We used a data set that includes conversations between physicians (N=38) and late-stage cancer patients (N=382). With statistical analysis, we show that physicians who were lecturing their patients and did not vary their positive sentiment had patients with prognosis misunderstanding.During global pandemics (e.g., COVID-19), when social distancing is recommended, most communication is taking place online.

22,2,40,If your device could smile: People trust happy-sounding artificial agents more,"Torre, I.; Goslin, J.; White, L.","While it is clear that artificial agents that are able to express emotions increase trust in Human–Machine Interaction, most studies looking at this effect concentrated on the expression of emotions through the visual channel, e.g. facial expressions. However, emotions can be expressed in the vocal channel too, yet the relationship between trust and vocally expressive agents has not yet been investigated. We use a game theory paradigm to examine the influence of smiling in the voice on trusting behavior towards a virtual agent, who responds either trustworthily or untrustworthily in an investment game. We found that a smiling voice increases trust, and that this effect persists over time, despite the accumulation of clear evidence regarding the agent’s level of trustworthiness in a negotiated interaction.

23,2,44,Let's be serious and have a laugh: Can humor support cooperation with a virtual agent?,"Kulms, P.; Kopp, S.; Krämer, N.C.","A crucial goal within human-computer interaction is to establish cooperation. There is evidence that among the tools being available, humor might be a promising and not uncommon choice. The appeal of humor is supported by its fundamentality for human-human interaction and the variety of functions humor serves, for it can achieve much more than making the user smile. In the present experiment, we sought to further investigate the potential effects of humor for virtual agents. Subjects played the iterated prisoner's dilemma with a virtual agent that was intended to be funny or not. Additionally, we manipulated cooperativeness of the agent. First, although humor did not increase cooperation among subjects, our results indicate that humor modulates how cooperation is perceived in an agent. Second, humor facilitated the interaction with respect to enjoyment and rapport. Third, although increased enjoyment and overall affective reactions were both measured subjectively, the results were not in line with each other. © 2014 Springer International Publishing

24,2,47,Persuaded by the machine: The effect of virtual nonverbal cues and individual differences on compliance in economic bargaining,"Harjunen, V.J.; Spapé, M.; Ahmed, I.; Jacucci, G.; Ravaja, N.","Receiving a touch or smile increases compliance in natural face-to-face settings. It has been unclear, however, whether a virtual agent's touch and smile also promote compliance or whether there are individual differences in proneness to nonverbal persuasion. Utilizing a multimodal virtual reality, we investigated whether touch and smile promoted compliance to a virtual agent's requests and whether receiver's personality modulated the effects. Compliance was measured using the ultimatum game, in which participants were asked to either reject or accept an agent's monetary offers. Decision-making data were accompanied by offer-related cardiac responses, both of which were analyzed as a function of expression (anger, neutral, and happiness), touch (visuo-tactile, visual, no touch), and three personality traits: behavioral inhibition/activation system sensitivity (BIS/BAS) and justice sensitivity. People accepted unfair offers more often if the agents smiled or touched them. The effect of touch was more enhanced in those with low justice sensitivity and BAS, whereas facial expressions affected those with high BIS the most. Unfair offers amplified the cardiac response, but this effect was not dependent on nonverbal cues.

25,2,55,Social evaluations of embodied agents and avatars,"Guadagno, R.E.; Swinth, K.R.; Blascovich, J.","The purpose of this study was to examine social evaluations (i.e., perceptions of empathy and positivity) following peoples' interactions with digital human representations. Female research participants engaged in a 3-min interaction while immersed in a 3-D immersive virtual environment with a peer counselor. Participants were led to believe that the peer counselor was either an embodied agent (i.e., computer algorithm) or an avatar (i.e., another person). During the interaction, the peer counselor either smiled or not. As predicted, a digitally-rendered smile was found to affect participants' social evaluations. However, these effects were moderated by participants' beliefs about their interaction partner. Specifically, smiles enhanced social evaluations of embodied agents but degraded them for avatars. Although these results are consistent with other findings concerning the communicative realism of embodied agents and avatars they uniquely demonstrate that people's beliefs alone, rather than actual differences in virtual representations, can impact social evaluations.

26,2,57,Social Skills Training with Virtual Assistant and Real-Time Feedback,"Ali, M. R.; Hoque, E.","Nonverbal cues are considered the most important part in social communication. Many people desire people; but due to the stigma and unavailability of resources, they are unable to practice their social skills. In this work, we envision a virtual assistant that can give individuals real-time feedback on their smiles, eye-contact, body language and volume modulation that is available anytime, anywhere using a computer browser. To instantiate our idea, we have set up a Wizard-of-Oz study in the context of speed-dating with 47 individuals. We collected videos of the participants having a conversation with a virtual agent before and after of a speed-dating session. This study revealed that the participants who used our system improved their gesture in a face-to-face conversation. Our next goal is to explore different machine learning techniques on the facial and prosodic features to automatically generate feedback on the nonverbal cues.

27,2,64,Survival at the Museum: A Cooperation Experiment with Emotionally Expressive Virtual Characters,"Torre, I.; Carrigan, E.; McCabe, K.; McDonnell, R.; Harte, N.","Correctly interpreting an interlocutor's emotional expression is paramount to a successful interaction. But what happens when one of the interlocutors is a machine? The facilitation of human-machine communication and cooperation is of growing importance as smartphones, autonomous cars, or social robots increasingly pervade human social spaces. Previous research has shown that emotionally expressive virtual characters generally elicit higher cooperation and trust than 'neutral' ones. Since emotional expressions are multi-modal, and given that virtual characters can be designed to our liking in all their components, would a mismatch in the emotion expressed in the face and voice influence people's cooperation with a virtual character? We developed a game where people had to cooperate with a virtual character in order to survive on the moon. The character's face and voice were designed to either smile or not, resulting in 4 conditions: smiling voice and face, neutral voice and face, smiling voice only (neutral face), smiling face only (neutral voice). The experiment was set up in a museum over the course of several weeks; we report preliminary results from over 500 visitors, showing that people tend to trust the virtual character in the mismatched condition with the smiling face and neutral voice more.

28,2,67,The Impact of Agent Facial Mimicry on Social Behavior in a Prisoner's Dilemma,"Hoegen, R.; van der Schalk, J.; Lucas, G.; Gratch, J.","A long tradition of research suggests a relationship between emotional mimicry and pro-social behavior, but the nature of this relationship is unclear. Does mimicry cause rapport and cooperation, or merely reflect it? Virtual humans can provide unique insights into these social processes by allowing unprecedented levels of experimental control. In a 2 x 2 factorial design, we examined the impact of facial mimicry and counter-mimicry in the iterated prisoner's dilemma. Participants played with an agent that copied their smiles and frowns or one that showed the opposite pattern – i.e., that frowned when they smiled. As people tend to smile more than frown, we independently manipulated the contingency of expressions to ensure any effects are due to mimicry alone, and not the overall positivity/negativity of the agent: i.e., participants saw either a reflection of their own expressions or saw the expressions shown to a previous participant. Results show that participants smiled significantly more when playing an agent that mimicked them. Results also show a complex association between smiling, feelings of rapport, and cooperation.

29,2,69,The interpersonal effect of emotion in decision-making and social dilemmas,"de Melo, Celso. M.","Recent decades have seen increased interest on the role of emotional expression in human-computer interaction. However, despite a growing number of empirical findings reported in the literature, the results are still inconclusive about the mechanism for the social effects of emotion. This dissertation studies how emotion displays in computers impact people's decision-making and proposes a mechanism for such effects based on appraisal theories of emotion. In appraisal theories, emotion displays arise from cognitive appraisal of events with respect to one's goals (e.g., is this event congruent with my goals? Who is responsible for this event?). According to the pattern of appraisals that occurs, different emotions are experienced and displayed. Since displays reflect the agent's intentions through the appraisal process, we argue people infer, from emotion displays, how computer agents are appraising the ongoing interaction and, from this information, make inferences about the agents' intentions. We refer to this theory as reverse appraisal. To support it, several empirical studies are presented where participants engage in the iterated prisoner's dilemma with virtual agents that, though following the same strategy to choose their actions, display emotions in the face that are consistent with either cooperative or competitive goals. The results confirm that emotion displays impact people's decision making and people cooperate more with cooperative agents. Consistent with reverse appraisal's prediction that what is critical for the effects is not the emotion but the underlying appraisals, the results also show that the same display (e.g., a smile) can lead to opposite effects on cooperation depending on the context in which it is shown. A final study shows that people can successfully retrieve, from emotion displays, information about how agents are appraising the ongoing interaction; moreover, these perceptions of appraisal are shown to mediate the effect of emotion displays on perceptions of the agents' likelihood of cooperation. Having established the theoretical foundations of reverse appraisal, the dissertation presents several computational models of decision-making in the prisoner's dilemma. These models were developed by applying statistical and machine learning techniques on the data collected in the studies. Experimental results show that, as expected, computer models can better replicate human behavior in the original studies if they take into consideration the counterpart's appraisals and emotion displays. In addition, the dissertation also contributes a platform for creating realistic embodied agents that can display emotion. This platform was used in all studies to implement the experimental manipulations and can be used as a research tool to study human-agent and human-human interaction.

30,3,4,A Methodology for the Automatic Extraction and Generation of Non-Verbal Signals Sequences Conveying Interpersonal Attitudes,"Chollet, M.; Ochs, M.; Pelachaud, C.","In many applications, Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs) must be able to express various affects such as emotions or social attitudes. Non-verbal signals, such as smiles or gestures, contribute to the expression of attitudes. Social attitudes affect the whole behavior of a person: they are ldquocharacteristic of an affective style that colors the entire interactionrdquo [1] . Moreover, recent findings have demonstrated that non-verbal signals are not interpreted in isolation but along with surrounding signals. Non-verbal behavior planning models designed to allow ECAs to express attitudes should thus consider complete sequences of non-verbal signals and not only signals independently of one another. However, existing models do not take this into account, or in a limited manner. The contribution of this paper is a methodology for the automatic extraction of sequences of non-verbal signals characteristic of a social phenomenon from a multimodal corpus, and a non-verbal behavior planning model that takes into account sequences of non-verbal signals rather than signals independently.

31,3,12,Comparing emotional vs. envelope feedback for ECAs,"Von Der Pütten, A.; Reipen, C.; Wiedmann, A.; Kopp, S.; Krämer, N.C.","Opinions in the scientific community differ about what makes an ECA effective. This study investigated whether emotional expressions influence the effectiveness of human-agent-interaction the participantś emotional status after the experiment. 70 participants took part in a small talk (10 min.) situation with the ECA MAX. We implemented two different types of feedback: emotional feedback (EMO), which provided a feedback about the emotional state of MAX (including smiles and compliments) and envelope feedback (ENV), which provided a feedback about the comprehension of the participantś contributions and presents MAX as an attentive listener. We found that smiling was the only nonverbal behaviour which was significantly recognized and that the emotional feedback led to increased feelings of interest in the participants.

32,3,14,Computational model of believable conversational agents,"Pelachaud, C.; Bilvi, M.","In this chapter we present the issues and problems involved in the creation of Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs). These agents may have a humanoid aspect and may be embedded in a user interface with the capacity to interact with the user; that is they are able to perceive and understand what the user is saying, but also to answer verbally and nonverbally to the user. ECAs are expected to interact with users as in human-human conversation. They should smile, raise their brows, nod, and even gesticulate, not in a random manner but in co-occurrence with their speech. Results from research in human-human communication are applied to human-ECA communication, or ECA-ECA communication. The creation of such agents requires several steps ranging from the creation of the geometry of the body and facial models to the modeling of their mind, emotion, and personality, but also to the computation of the facial expression, body gesture, gaze that accompany their speech.

33,3,24,ERiSA: Building emotionally realistic social game-agents companions,"Chowanda, A.; Blanchfield, P.; Flintham, M.; Valstar, M.","We propose an integrated framework for social and emotional game-agents to enhance their believability and quality of interaction, in particular by allowing an agent to forge social relations and make appropriate use of social signals. The framework is modular including sensing, interpretation, behaviour generation, and game components. We propose a generic formulation of action selection rules based on observed social and emotional signals, the agent's personality, and the social relation between agent and player. The rules are formulated such that its variables can easily be obtained from real data.

34,3,25,Exploring the difference of the impression on human and agent listeners in active listening dialog,"Huang, H.-H.; Konishi, N.; Shibusawa, S.; Kawagoe, K.","Active listening is a communication technique that the listener listens to the speaker carefully and attentively by confirming or asking for more details aboutwhat they heard. In order to improve the effect, always-available and trustable conversational partners in enough number are demanded. The ultimate goal of this study is the development of a virtual agent who can engage active listening and maintain a long-term relationship with elderly users. We assume that the task of the active listener (a human volunteer or the agent) is to maintain the speaker's (elderly user) mood in good state. In order to do this, like a human listener, the listener agent has to observe the listener's attitude, has to estimate the listener's mood from the observation, and has to predict the change of listener's mood caused by his / her own behaviors both verbally and non-verbally. On the other hand, the active listener is evaluated by the speaker from his / her impression of the listener's attitude. The hypothesis is, if the impression is good, then the speaker's mood is good. However, virtual agents which are made by computer graphics animations are more limited in expressiveness than human listeners, both in the aspects of quality and communication channels. Therefore, there is a research question that the graphical agent with ""reduced expressiveness"" can really engage the active listening task at human listeners' level, even if they do the same behaviors, smiles, gestures, or utterances at the same timings.

35,3,31,From analysis to modeling of engagement as sequences of multimodal behaviors,"Dermouche, S.; Pelachaud, C.","In this paper, we present an approach to endow an Embodied Conversational Agent with engagement capabilities. We relied on a corpus of expert-novice interactions. Two types of manual annotation were conducted: non-verbal signals such as gestures, head movements and smiles; engagement level of both expert and novice during the interaction. Then, we used a temporal sequence mining algorithm to extract non-verbal sequences eliciting variation of engagement perception. Our aim is to apply these findings in human-agent interaction to analyze user's engagement level and to control agent's behavior.

36,3,35,Greta: An Interactive Expressive Embodied Conversational Agent,"Pelachaud, C.","Greta is an interactive Embodied Conversational Agent platform. It is endowed with socio-emotional and communicative behaviors. Through its behaviors, the agent can sustain a conversation as well as show various attitudes and levels of engagement. Through the years, we have integrated all our research in the Greta platform. By applying different methodologies, based on corpus analysis, user-centered, or motion capture, we have enriched the agent's palette of multimodal behaviors. We have conducted various studies to simulate communicative behaviors, emotional behaviors, social attitudes and behavior expressivity. In particular we have proposed models to go beyond the prototypical expressions of emotions. Through its behaviors patterns, the agent can display complex emotions such as masking one expression of emotions by another ones, its relationship towards its interlocutors, specific social signals such as smile and laughter. In an interaction, the agent can be a speaker or a listener. It can exhibit backchannels, mimic on the fly its interlocutor's behaviors. To develop our models, we rely on theoretical models from social psychology literature and on data analysis.After describing our platform, we will first review our rationale; then we will introduce our model of socio-emotional behaviors.

37,3,41,Influences on embodied conversational agent's expressivity: toward an individualization of the ECAs,"Maya, V.; Lamolle, M.; Pelachaud, C.","We aim at creating, not a generic embodied conversational agents (ECAs) but, an agent with a specific individuality. Our approach is based on different expressivities: the agent's expressivity, the communicative of behavioral expressivity. Contextual factors as well as factors such as culture and personality shape the expressivity of an agent. We call such factors ""influences"". Expressivity is described in terms of signals (e.g. smile, hand gesture, look at) and their temporal course. In this paper, we are interested in modelling the effects influences may have in the determination of signals. We propose a computational model of these influences and of the agent's expressivity. We have developed a taxonomy of signals according to their modality (i.e. face, posture, gesture or gaze), to their related meaning and to their correspondence to expressivity domains (the range of expressivity that they may express). This model takes also into account the signals dynamic intantiation, i.e. the modification of signals alter their expressivity (without modifying the corresponding meaning).",2004,,,,75-85,,Maya

38,3,49,Power of a nod and a glance: envelope vs. emotional feedback in animated conversational agents,"Cassell, J.; Thorisson, Kristinn R.","In this article we describe results from an experiment of user interaction with autonomous, human-like (humanoid) conversational agents. We hypothesize that for embodied conversational agents, nonverbal behaviors related to the process of conversation, what we call envelope feedback, is much more important than other feedback, such as emotional expression. We test this hypothesis by having subjects interact with three autonomous agents, all capable of full-duplex multimodal interaction: able to generate and recognize speech, intonation, facial displays, and gesture. Each agent, however, gave a different kind of feedback: (1) content-related only, (2) content + envelope feedback, and (3) content + emotional. Content-related feedback includes answering questions and executing commands; envelope feedback includes behaviors such as gaze, manual beat gesture, and head movements; emotional feedback includes smiles and looks of puzzlement. Subjects' evaluations of the system were collected with a questionnaire, and videotapes of their speech patterns and behaviors were scored according to how often the users repeated themselves, how often they hesitated, and how often they got frustrated. The results confirm our hypothesis that envelope feedback is more important in interaction than emotional feedback and that envelope feedback plays a crucial role in supporting the process of dialog. A secondary result from this study shows that users give our multimodal conversational humanoids very high ratings of lifelikeness and fluidity of interaction when the agents are capable of giving

39,3,59,Socially-aware virtual agents: automatically assessing dyadic rapport from temporal patterns of behavior,"Ran Z.; Sinha, T.; Black, A.W.; Cassell, J.","This work focuses on data-driven discovery of the temporally co-occurring and contingent behavioral patterns that signal high and low interpersonal rapport. We mined a reciprocal peer tutoring corpus reliably annotated for nonverbals like eye gaze and smiles, conversational strategies like self-disclosure and social norm violation, and for rapport (in 30 s thin slices). We then performed a fine-grained investigation of how the temporal profiles of sequences of interlocutor behaviors predict increases and decreases of rapport, and how this rapport management manifests differently in friends and strangers. We validated the discovered behavioral patterns by predicting rapport against our ground truth via a forecasting model involving two-step fusion of learned temporal associated rules. Our framework performs significantly better than a baseline linear regression method that does not encode temporal information among behavioral features.

40,3,68,The impact of different embodied agent-feedback on users behavior,"Von Der Pütten, A.; Reipen, C.; Wiedmann, A.; Kopp, S.; Krämer, N.C.","This study investigated whether emotional expressions of an ECA influence the participants nonverbal and verbal behavior. 70 participants took part in a small talk (10 min.) situation with the ECA MAX who was presented with two different types of feedback: emotional feedback (EMO), which provided a feedback about the emotional state of MAX (including smiles and compliments) and envelope feedback (ENV), which provided a feedback about the comprehension of the participants contributions. In general we found that participants showed frequent behavior known from human-human-communication, such as proactive greetings or waving goodbye.

41,3,70,The power of a nod and a glance: envelope vs. emotional feedback in animated conversational agents,"Cassell, J.; Thorisson, K.R.","We describe results from an experiment of user interaction with autonomous, human-like (humanoid) conversational agents. We hypothesize that for embodied conversational agents, nonverbal behaviours related to the process of conversation, what we call envelope feedback, is much more important than other feedback, such as emotional expression. We test this hypothesis by having subjects interact with three autonomous agents, all capable of full-duplex multimodal interaction: able to generate and recognize speech, intonation, facial displays, and gesture. Each agent, however, gave a different kind of feedback: (1) content-related only, (2) content+envelope feedback, and (3) content+emotional. Content-related feedback includes answering questions and executing commands; envelope feedback includes behaviours such as gaze, manual beat gesture, and head movements; emotional feedback includes smiles and looks of puzzlement. Subjects' evaluations of the system were collected with a questionnaire, and videotapes of their speech patterns and behaviours were scored according to how often the users repeated themselves, how often they hesitated, and how often they got frustrated. The results confirm our hypothesis that envelope feedback is more important in interaction than emotional feedback and that envelope feedback plays a crucial role in supporting the process of dialog. A secondary result from this study shows that users give our multimodal conversational humanoids very high ratings of lifelikeness and fluidity of interaction when the agents are capable of giving

42,3,73,Towards a listening agent: A system generating audiovisual laughs and smiles to show interest,"El-Haddad, K.; Çakmak, H.; Gilmartin, E.; Dupont, S.; Dutoit, T.","In this work, we experiment with the use of smiling and laughter in order to help create more natural and efficient listening agents. We present preliminary results on a sys-Tem which predicts smile and laughter sequences in one dialogue participant based on observations of the other par-Ticipant's behavior. This system also predicts the level of intensity or arousal for these sequences. We also describe an audiovisual (AV) concatenative synthesis process used to generate laughter and smiling sequences, producing multi- level amusement expressions from a dataset of audiovisual laughs. We thus present two contributions: one in the generation of smiling and laughter responses, the other in the prediction of what laughter and smiles to use in response to an interlocutor's behaviour. Both the synthesis system and the prediction system have been evaluated via Mean Opinion Score tests and have proved to give satisfying and promising results which open the door to interesting

43,4,18,Design of a Product Recommendation Virtual Agent That Induces User’s Trust Operating User’s Trust,"Matsui, T.; Yamada, S.","The PRVAs, product recommendation virtual agent, are the agents that take part in the clerks on the onlineshopping. For their aims, it is very important for the PRVAs to be trusted by users. However, trustworthy the PRVA design was not be studied yet. In this paper, we suggest the user’s trust transition model that is consisted by two parameters. One parameter is user’s emotion, and the other is agent’s knowledge. We suggested the transition operators that transited these two parameters by executing when the PRVAs recommend. Emotion transition operators are agent’s smile and gestures. Knowledge transition operators is long product recommendation text. We carried on three experiments to estimate these model and transition operators. In experiment 1, we executed no transition operators. In experiment 2, we executed emotion transition operators and added knowledge transition operators in the latter half. In experiment 3, we executed knowledge transition operators in the first half and added emotion transition operators in the latter half. As a results, it is discovered that transition operators and a transition model are effective. In experiment 1, there are no transition in the participants’ trust state. In experiment 2, the participants’knowledge perceived and trust for agent transited after executing knowledge transition operators. In experiment 3, the participants’ emotion transited after executing positive emotion operators, however, trust didn’t transited.

44,4,19,"Designing and evaluating digital game-based learning with the arcs motivation model, humor, and animation","Lee, L.-C.; Hao, K.-C.","Multimedia teaching applications have been widely utilized in various subjects. The presentation of teaching materials with animations and games helps to stimulate the visual sense and enhance the learning motivation of learners. Successful learning, however, requires the stimulation of learning motivation that can inspire learners to achieve the desired learning objectives. This study combines the ARCS (Attention, Relevance, Confidence, Satisfaction) motivation model, and humor to design a set of multimedia applications that include teaching animations and games for sixth graders' natural science and technology course, called the Cat's Cradle Multimedia Learning System (CCMLS). The scenario stories of anthropomorphic characters introduce four units of natural science: levers, axles, pulleys and gears. Additionally, games are designed to impress learners even more. After the applications were prepared, tests for learning effectiveness, learning motivation and perceived fun associated with teaching materials were conducted with 106 students at the Qishan Elementary School in Kaohsiung. The experimental group used CCMLS, while the control group used videos of the textbook as the applications. A pre-test and post-test, ARCS Learning Motivation Questionnaire, Smileyometer and interviews were conducted with both groups. According to the statistical analysis, significance was detected in regard to learning effectiveness between the experimental group and the control group. Significance was also found in ARCS learning motivation and perceived fun of teaching materials. Moreover, there is a significant positive correlation between the perceived fun related to the teaching materials and learning motivation. The contribution of this study lies in the proposal of the digital game-based learning (DGBL) from the design perspective: to enhance students' learning motivation and use willingness regarding the teaching materials of the drama and the cartoon characters in humorous dialogues. The proper sound and light effects and examples that are close to daily life will also be taken into consideration in the design of the multimedia applications.

45,4,22,Emotional contagion between user and product recommendation virtual agent,"Matsui, T.; Yamada, S.","The notion of Emotional contagion is a phenomenon in which a human emotion infects others. Various studies have been done to cause emotional contagion between a human and a robot or an anthropomorphic agent in HRI research fields. However, few studies have been done to compare different kinds of agents in order to find important properties in emotional contagion in human-agent interaction (HAI). In this research, we conducted an experiment to determine which properties cause this phenomenon between anthropomorphic agents and users. We prepared two kinds of agents. One is a cartoon-like agent, and the other is a concrete agent. The cartoon-like agent smiled exaggeratedly, and the concrete agent smiled modestly. As a result, we found that the concrete agent was more effective than the cartoon-like agent at emotional contagion.

46,4,28,First impressions in human-agent virtual encounters,"Cafaro, A.; Vilhjálmsson, H.H.; Bickmore, T.","In greeting encounters, first impressions of personality and attitude are quickly formed and might determine important relational decisions, such as the likelihood and frequency of subsequent encounters. An anthropomorphic user interface is not immune to these judgments, specifically when exhibiting social interaction skills in public spaces. A favorable impression may help engaging users in interaction and attaining acceptance for long-term interactions. We present three studies implementing a model of first impressions for initiating user interactions with an anthropomorphic museum guide agent with socio-relational skills. We focus on nonverbal behavior exhibiting personality and interpersonal attitude. In two laboratory studies, we demonstrate that impressions of an agent's personality are quickly formed based on proximity, whereas interpersonal attitude is conveyed through smile and gaze. We also found that interpersonal attitude has greater impact than personality on the user's decision to spend time with the agent. These findings are then applied to a museum guide agent exhibited at the Boston Museum of Science.

47,4,29,First impressions in user-agent encounters: The impact of an agent's nonverbal behavior on users' relational decisions,"Cafaro, A.; Vilhjálmsson, H.H.; Bickmore, T.; Heylen, D.; Schulman, D.","We present an empirical study that investigates whether the first impressions that users form of a virtual agent have an impact on attitudes and subsequent relational behavior. Subjects experienced brief approaches to several embodied agent guides in an immersive 3D virtual museum environment. Each guide exhibited two levels (low vs. high) of extraversion and friendliness towards the subjects by using nonverbal immediacy cues of smile, gaze and proxemics. We found that the nonverbal behavior exhibited by our guides in these 12.5 second encounters, had significant effects on subjects' relational decisions in terms of how likely and how often they would like to spend time with the guides on virtual tours. In particular, guide friendliness, expressed by smiling and gazing more at the subjects, had a positive main effect for all our measures.

48,4,30,First Impressions: Users' Judgments of Virtual Agents' Personality and Interpersonal Attitude in First Encounters,"Cafaro, A.; Vilhjálmsson, H.H.; Bickmore, T.; Heylen, D.; Johannsdottir, K.R.; Valgarosson, G.S.","In first encounters people quickly form impressions of each other's personality and interpersonal attitude. We conducted a study to investigate how this transfers to first encounters between humans and virtual agents. In the study, subjects' avatars approached greeting agents in a virtual museum rendered in both first and third person perspective. Each agent exclusively exhibited nonverbal immediacy cues (smile, gaze and proximity) during the approach. Afterwards subjects judged its personality (extraversion) and interpersonal attitude (hostility/friendliness). We found that within only 12.5 seconds of interaction subjects formed impressions of the agents based on observed behavior.

49,4,75,Virtual customer service agents: Using social presence and personalization to shape online service encounters,"Verhagen, T.; van Nes, J.; Feldberg, F.; van Dolen, W.","By performing tasks traditionally fulfilled by service personnel and having a humanlike appearance, virtual customer service agents bring classical service elements to the web, which may positively influence customer satisfaction through eliciting social responses and feelings of personalization. This paper sheds light on these dynamics by proposing and testing a model drawing upon the theories of implicit personality, social response, emotional contagion, and social interaction. The model proposes friendliness, expertise, and smile as determinants of social presence, personalization, and online service encounter satisfaction. An empirical study confirms the cross-channel applicability of friendliness and expertise as determinants of social presence and personalization.

50,5,1,3D numerical definition with vectors for human smiles,"Li, S.-R.; Chen, K.; Ma, M.-Y.","In most of the numerical methods for facial expressions in the literatures, the number of the key controls for animators or robot programmers are too complex and trivial, because what they want are less and critical controls. This study explored varied types of human smiles and extracted proper key factors affecting the smiles. These key factors then were converted into a set of control points which could serve to satisfy the needs for creation of facial expression for 3D animators and be further applied to the face simulation for robots in the future. First, hundreds of human smile pictures were collected and analyzed to identify the key factors for face expression. Then, the factors were converted into a set of control points and sizing parameters calculated proportionally. Finally, two different faces were constructed for validating the parameters via the process of simulating smiles of the same type as the original one. © 2011 Academic Journal.",2011,Int. J. Phys.

51,5,9,Bilinear kernel reduced rank regression for facial expression synthesis,"Huang, D.; De La Torre, F.","In the last few years, Facial Expression Synthesis (FES) has been a flourishing area of research driven by applications in character animation, computer games, and human computer interaction. This paper proposes a photo-realistic FES method based on Bilinear Kernel Reduced Rank Regression (BKRRR). BKRRR learns a high-dimensional mapping between the appearance of a neutral face and a variety of expressions (e.g. smile, surprise, squint). There are two main contributions in this paper: (1) Propose BKRRR for FES. Several algorithms for learning the parameters of BKRRR are evaluated. (2) Propose a new method to preserve subtle person-specific facial characteristics (e.g. wrinkles, pimples).

52,5,26,Expressive MPEG-4 Facial Animation Using Quadratic Deformation Models,"Obaid, M.; Mukundan, R.; Billinghurst, M.; Pelachaud, C.","In this paper we propose an approach compliant with the MPEG-4 standard to synthesize and control facial expressions generated using 3D facial models. This is achieved by establishing the MPEG-4 facial animation standard conformity with the quadratic deformation model representations of facial expressions. This conformity allows us to utilize the MPEG-4 facial animation parameters (FAPs) with the quadratic deformation tables, as a higher layer, to compute the FAP values. The FAP values for an expression E are computed by performing a linear mapping between a set of transformed MPEG-4 FAP points (using quadratic deformation models) and the 3D facial model semantics. The nature of the quadratic deformation model representations of facial expressions can be employed to synthesize and control the six main expressions (smile, sad, fear, surprise, anger, and disgust). Using Whissel's psychological studies on emotions we compute an interpolation parameter that is used to synthesize intermediate facial expressions. The paper presents results of experimental studies performed using the Greta embodied conversational agent.

53,5,39,Identifying Differences between a Straight Face and a Posed Smile Using the Homologous Modeling Technique and the Principal Component Analysis,"Yasuda, K.; Nakano, H.; Yamada, T.; Albougha, S.; Inoue, K.; Nakashima, A.; Kamata, Y.; Sugiyama, G.; Tajiri, S.; Sumida, T.; Mishima, K.; Mori, Y.","Recently, a homologous modeling method was developed to simulate 3D human body forms, which can visualize principal component analysis (PCA) results and facilitate its detailed comparison with results of previous method. Herein, we aimed to construct a homologous model of the face to identify differences between a straight face and a posed smile. Thirty-eight volunteers (19 males and 19 females, 38 straight faces and 38 posed smiles) with no medical history associated with a posed smile were enrolled. Three-dimensional images were constructed using the Homologous Body Modeling software and the HBM-Rugle; 9 landmarks were identified on the 3D-model surfaces. The template model automatically fitted into an individually scanned point cloud of the face by minimizing external and internal energy functions. Faces were analyzed using PCA; differences between straight faces and posed smiles were analyzed using paired t tests. Contribution of the most important principal component was 23.8%; 8 principal components explained >75% of the total variance. A significant difference between a straight face and a posed smile was observed in the second and the fourth principal components. The second principal component images revealed differences between a straight face and a posed smile and changes around the chin area with regard to length, shape, and anteroposterior position. Such changes were inclusive of individual differences. However, the fourth principal component image only revealed differences between a straight face and a posed smile; observed differences included simultaneous shortening of upper and lower eyelid length, evaluation of the nasal ala ase, swelling of the cheek area, and elevation of the mouth angle. Although these results were clinically apparent, we believe that this article is the first to statistically verify the same. Consequently, the homologous model technique and PCA are useful for evaluation of the facial soft-tissue changes. Copyright © 2019 by Mutaz B. Habal, MD.",2019,J. Craniofac.

54,5,48,Pogany: A tangible cephalomorphic interface for expressive facial animation,"Jacquemin, C.","A head-shaped input device is used to produce expressive facial animations. The physical interface is divided into zones, and each zone controls an expression on a smiley or on a virtual 3D face. Through contacts with the interface users can generate basic or blended expressions. To evaluate the interface and to analyze the behavior of the users, we performed a study made of three experiments in which subjects were asked to reproduce simple or more subtle expressions. The results show that the subjects easily accept the interface and get engaged in a pleasant affective relationship that make them feel as sculpting the virtual face.

55,5,52,Representations of 3D faces: Toward time complexity reduction and expression recognition,"Mudigonda, M.","We parametrize 3D faces with superquadrics and PCA techniques to support clustering. We verify the effectiveness of superquadrics finding axes of symmetry for 3D faces on pre-normalized datasets. We show that a superquadric fit to 2.5D face data in conjunction with other normalization techniques helps in bettering the normalization. This is observed by comparing 100 x 100 meshes of all faces using various normalization techniques; the top 10 eigen values represent about 99% energy with our method, 95% with only CFDM normalization and about 83% with superquadric normalization alone.    One of the goals of parametrization is to be able to show a robust partitioning of the dataset into smaller robust clusters, thus reducing the complexity of identification of faces. On the MSU data set we show that we can create about 20–30 clusters with an accuracy of about 83% using traditional k-means. We also show that using semi-supervised clustering techniques we are able to extend the number of clusters to higher numbers of 30–40. We analyze the various feature spaces proposed and show that shape curvatures (exponential parameters of superquadrics) contain maximal information (6.7).    We attempt to model expressions in 3D faces using Gabor filters and a novel method to parameterize clusters using convex hulls that extract the perimeter of clusters and apply PCA to parameterize the clusters. We show that such a model can fully automatically discriminate smile versus no expression with an accuracy of 78%.

56,5,76,When and how to smile: Emotional expression for 3D conversational agents,"Ngo, T.D.; Bui, T.D.","Conversational agents have become more and more common in the multimedia worlds of films, educative applications, e - business, computer games. Many techniques have been developed to enable these agents to behave in a human-like manner. In order to do so, conversational agents are simulated with emotion and personality as well as communicative channels such as voice, head and eye movement, manipulator and facial expression. Up to now, creating facial expression from emotions has received much attention. However, most of the work concentrates on producing static facial expressions from emotions. In this paper, we propose a scheme for displaying continuous emotional states of a conversational agent on a 3D face. The main idea behind the scheme is that an emotional facial expression happens for a few seconds only when there is a significant change in the emotional states. This makes the emotional facial expressions of the conversational agents more realistic due to the fact that a facial expression only stay on the face for a few seconds. © Springer-Verlag Berlin

57,6,38,How to Shape the Humor of a Robot - Social Behavior Adaptation Based on Reinforcement Learning,"Weber, K.; Ritschel, H.; Aslan, I.; Lingenfelser, F.; André, E.","A shared sense of humor can result in positive feelings associated with amusement, laughter, and moments of bonding. If robotic companions could acquire their human counterparts' sense of humor in an unobtrusive manner, they could improve their skills of engagement. In order to explore this assumption, we have developed a dynamic user modeling approach based on Reinforcement Learning, which allows a robot to analyze a person's reaction while it tells jokes and continuously adapts its sense of humor. We evaluated our approach in a test scenario with a Reeti robot acting as an entertainer and telling different types of jokes. The exemplary adaptation process is accomplished only by using the audience's vocal laughs and visual smiles, but no other form of explicit feedback. We report on results of a user study with 24 participants, comparing our approach to a baseline condition (with a non-learning version of the robot) and conclude by providing limitations and

58,6,62,Subjective Speech Can Be Useful for Persuasive Virtual Humans,"Matsui, T.; Yamada, S.","In this work, we developed virtual humans (VH) designed to persuade users. We introduce the notion of distinctiveness of topics and define two kinds of persuasion strategies: ""objective persuasion"", which aims to persuade with only objective sentences and no expression, and ""subjective persuasion"", which aims to persuade with only subjective sentences and smiles and gestures. We performed experiments in which a VH recommended trips under two conditions. In condition 1, the VH recommended a topic that she preferred using subjective persuasion and another topic using objective persuasion.

59,6,63,Subjective Speech Can Be Useful for Persuasive Virtual Humans: Executing Distinctiveness to Increase the Virtual Humans' Trustworthiness and Persuasion Effect,"Matsui, T.; Yamada, S.","In this work, we developed virtual humans (VH) designed to persuade users. We introduce the notion of distinctiveness of topics and define two kinds of persuasion strategies: ""objective persuasion"", which aims to persuade with only objective sentences and no expression, and ""subjective persuasion"", which aims to persuade with only subjective sentences and smiles and gestures. We performed experiments in which a VH recommended trips under two conditions. In condition 1, the VH recommended a topic that she preferred using subjective persuasion and another topic using objective persuasion.

60,6,72,Toddler word learning from contingent screens with and without human presence,"Tsuji, S.; Fiévét, A.-C.; Cristia, A.","While previous studies have documented that toddlers learn less well from passive screens than from live interaction, the rise of interactive, digital screen media opens new perspectives, since some work has shown that toddlers can learn similarly well from a human present via video chat as from live exposure. The present study aimed to disentangle the role of human presence from other aspects of social interactions on learning advantages in contingent screen settings. We assessed 16-month-old toddlers’ fast mapping of novel words from screen in three conditions: in-person, video chat, and virtual agent. All conditions built on the same controlled and scripted interaction. In the in-person condition, toddlers learned two novel word-object associations from an experimenter present in the same room and reacting contingently to infants’ gaze direction. In the video chat condition, the toddler saw the experimenter in real time on screen, while the experimenter only had access to the toddler's real-time gaze position as captured by an eyetracker. This setup allowed contingent reactivity to the toddler's gaze while controlling for any cues beyond these instructions. The virtual agent condition was programmed to follow the infant's gaze, to smile, and to name the object with the same parameters as the experimenter in the other conditions. After the learning phase, all toddlers were tested on their word recognition in a looking-while-listening paradigm. Comparisons against chance revealed that toddlers showed above-chance word learning in the in-person group only. Toddlers in the virtual agent group showed significantly worse performance than those in the in-person group, while performance in the video chat group overlapped with the other two groups. These results confirm that in-person interaction leads to best learning outcomes even in the absence of rich social cues. They also elucidate that contingency is not sufficient either, and that in order for toddlers to learn from interactive digital media, more cues to social agency are required. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",2021,Infant Behav.

62,8,3,A Data-Driven Method for Variation in Animated Smiles: Extended Abstract,"Sohre, N.; Guy, S.J.","Animated digital characters play an important role in virtual experiences. In this work, we utilize data from a large scale user study as training data for a generative model for producing a variety of animated smiles. Our method involves a four stage process that samples a variety of facial expressions, and annotates them with perceived happiness from the user study.

63,8,17,Creating genuine smiles for digital and robotic characters: An empirical study,"Si, M.; McDaniel, J.D.","Facial expressions are important cues of people's emotions, attitudes, and intentions. Smiling is one of the most common facial expressions and is often associated with a welcoming, positive attitude. In social interactions, people sometimes fake their smiles for this effect, and phony fake smiles can often be detected by others. In this work, we explore creating smiles for digital and robotic s characters that seem genuine. In our study, we used male and female digital characters and a Zeno boy robot that is a humanoid robot with facial muscles. We systematically varied the overall length and the apex length of the smiles and examined people's perceptions of them. Our results indicate that smiles with longer apex lengths appear more genuine and less fake to people for both digital characters and social robots, and 5s seems to be the optimal length of a genuine

64,8,21,Effects of dynamic attributes of smiles in human and synthetic faces: A simulated job interview setting,"Krumhuber, E.; Manstead, A.S.R.; Cosker, D.; Marshall, D.; Rosin, P.L.","We examined the effects of the temporal quality of smile displays on impressions and decisions made in a simulated job interview. We also investigated whether similar judgments were made in response to synthetic (Study 1) and human facial stimuli (Study 2). Participants viewed short video excerpts of female interviewees exhibiting dynamic authentic smiles, dynamic fake smiles, or neutral expressions, and rated them with respect to a number of attributes. In both studies, perceivers' judgments and employment decisions were significantly shaped by the temporal quality of smiles, with dynamic authentic smiles generally leading to more favorable job, person, and expression ratings than dynamic fake smiles or neutral expressions. Furthermore, authentically smiling interviewees were judged to be more suitable and were more likely to be short-listed and selected for the job. The findings show a high degree of correspondence in the effects created by synthetic and human facial stimuli, suggesting that temporal features of smiles similarly influence perceivers' judgments and decisions across the two types of stimulus. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",2009,J.

65,8,33,From the Symbolic Analysis of Virtual Faces to a Smiles Machine,"Ochs, M.; Diday, E.; Afonso, F.","In this paper, we present an application of symbolic data processing for the design of virtual character's smiling facial expressions. A collected database of virtual character's smiles directly created by users has been explored using symbolic data analysis methods. An unsupervised analysis has enabled us to identify the morphological and dynamic characteristics of different types of smiles as well as of combinations of smiles. Based on the symbolic data analysis, to generate different smiling faces, we have developed procedures to automatically reconstitute smiling virtual faces from a point in a multidimensional space corresponding to a principal component analysis plane. © 2013 IEEE.",2016,IEEE Trans.

66,8,34,Generating artificial smile variations based on a psychological system-theoretic approach,"Borutta, I.; Sosnowski, S.; Zehetleitner, M.; Bischof, N.; Kuhnlenz, K.","Emotional expressions are considered to be important for robotic and virtual agents to improve non-verbal communication in human-machine-interaction. In this paper we focus on a subset of emotional expressions, namely the smile and it's variations. The proposed concept for generating artificial smile sequences is based on the system-theoretic psychological model of smiling, which is based on the Zurich Model of Social Motivation. The model and seven different types of smiles are introduced and it is presented how to integrate this model in a virtual agent.

67,8,50,PVL: A framework for navigating the precision-variety trade-off in automated animation of smiles,"Sohre, N.; Adeagbo, M.; Helwig, N.; Lyford-Pike, S.; Guy, S.J.","Animating digital characters has an important role in computer assisted experiences, from video games to movies to interactive robotics. A critical challenge in the field is to generate animations which accurately reflect the state of the animated characters, without looking repetitive or unnatural. In this work, we investigate the problem of procedurally generating a diverse variety of facial animations that express a given semantic quality (e.g., very happy). To that end, we introduce a new learning heuristic called Precision Variety Learning (PVL) which actively identifies and exploits the fundamental trade-off between precision (how accurate positive labels are) and variety (how diverse the set of positive labels is). We both identify conditions where important theoretical properties can be guaranteed, and show good empirical performance in variety of conditions. Lastly, we apply our PVL heuristic to our motivating problem of generating smile animations, and perform several user studies to validate the ability of our method to produce a perceptually diverse variety of smiles for different target intensities.

68,8,51,Realistic Transformation of Facial and Vocal Smiles in Real-Time Audiovisual Streams,"Arias, P.; Soladie, C.; Bouafif, O.; Roebel, A.; Seguier, R.; Aucouturier, J.-J.","Research in affective computing and cognitive science has shown the importance of emotional facial and vocal expressions during human-computer and human-human interactions. But, while models exist to control the display and interactive dynamics of emotional expressions, such as smiles, in embodied agents, these techniques can not be applied to video interactions between humans. In this work, we propose an audiovisual smile transformation algorithm able to manipulate an incoming video stream in real-time to parametrically control the amount of smile seen on the user's face and heard in their voice, while preserving other characteristics such as the user's identity or the timing and content of the interaction. The transformation is composed of separate audio and visual pipelines, both based on a warping technique informed by real-time detection of audio and visual landmarks. Taken together, these two parts constitute a unique audiovisual algorithm which, in addition to providing simultaneous real-time transformations of a real person's face and voice, allows to investigate the integration of both modalities of smiles in real-world social interactions. © 2018 IEEE.",2020,IEEE Trans.

69,8,60,Spatial and temporal linearities in posed and spontaneous smiles,"Trutoiu, L.C.; Carter, E.J.; Pollard, N.; Cohn, J.F.; Hodgins, J.K.","Creating facial animations that convey an animator's intent is a difficult task because animation techniques are necessarily an approximation of the subtle motion of the face. Some animation techniques may result in linearization of the motion of vertices in space (blendshapes, for example), and other, simpler techniques may result in linearization of the motion in time. In this article, we consider the problem of animating smiles and explore how these simplifications in space and time affect the perceived genuineness of smiles. We create realistic animations of spontaneous and posed smiles from high-resolution motion capture data for two computer-generated characters. The motion capture data is processed to linearize the spatial or temporal properties of the original animation. Through perceptual experiments, we evaluate the genuineness of the resulting smiles. Both space and time impact the perceived genuineness. We also investigate the effect of head motion in the perception of smiles and show similar results for the impact of linearization on animations with and without head motion. Our results indicate that spontaneous smiles are more heavily affected by linearizing the spatial and temporal properties than posed smiles. Moreover, the spontaneous smiles were more affected by temporal linearization than spatial linearization. Our results are in accordance with previous research on linearities in facial animation and allow us to conclude that a model of smiles must include a nonlinear model of velocities. © 2014 ACM.",2014,ACM Trans.

70,8,71,The temporal connection between smiles and blinks,"Trutoiu, L.C.; Hodgins, J.K.; Cohn, J.F.","In this paper, we present evidence for a temporal relationship between eye blinks and smile dynamics (smile onset and offset). Smiles and blinks occur with high frequency during social interaction, yet little is known about their temporal integration. To explore the temporal relationship between them, we used an Active Appearance Models algorithm to detect eye blinks in video sequences that contained manually FACS-coded spontaneous smiles (AU 12). We then computed the temporal distance between blinks and smile onsets and offsets. Our data shows that eye blinks are correlated with the end of the smile and occur close to the offset, but before the lip corners stop moving downwards. Furthermore, a marginally significant effect suggests that eye blinks are suppressed (less frequent) before smile onset. For computer-generated characters, this model of the timing of blinks relative to smiles may be useful in creating compelling facial animations. © 2013 IEEE.",2013,"2013 10th IEEE International

71,9,5,A perceptual and behavioral analysis of facial cues to deception in interactions between children and a virtual agent,"Serras P., M.; de Lange, J.; Shahid, S.; Swerts, M.","This study focused on the facial expressions that children exhibit while trying to deceive a virtual agent. An interactive lie elicitation game was developed to record children’s facial expressions during deceptive and truthful utterances. Our participants did this task either alone or in the presence of peers. A manual method and an automatic recognition approach were used to examine facial expressions and facial action units (AUs). Results show that the facial expressions of deceivers differ from those of truth-tellers: most clearly, they try to cover their lie as they smile significantly more often than truthful children. Moreover, co-presence enhances children’s facial expressive behavior and the number of deceptive cues. To understand whether such features serve as cues for deception detection, using data from children playing alone or together with another child, a perception test was carried out to examine observers’ ability to distinguish young deceivers from truth-tellers. Results show that observers found it easier to discriminate between deceivers and truth-tellers who had played the game in the co-present condition. Our research thus shows that virtual agents can be used as tools to elicit lies in a playful manner, which would be relevant for developmental, educational and behavioral analyses of deceit in growing children.

72,9,10,Catch me if you can - Exploring lying agents in social settings,"Rehm, M.; Andre, E.","Embodied conversational agents become more and more realistic concerning their conversational and their nonverbal behaviors. But if the information conveyed nonverbally exhibits clues that are not consistent with the verbal part of an agent's action, how will the user react to such a discrepancy? Masking ones real emotions with a smile is a naturally occuring example of such a discrepancy. But such masks are often deficient and thus subtle clues of lying and deceiving manifest themselves in facial expressions. The questions is how users will react to these clues if they are conveyed by an agent. Will they render an application unattractive or on the contrary more human-like? In this paper, we examine such facial clues to deception and present the results of two empirical studies: i.) lies in monologues by a talking head presenting movies, ii.) lies in an interactive game of dice.

73,9,11,Children's facial expressions in truthful and deceptive interactions with a virtual agent,"Pereira, M.S.; De Lange, J.; Shahid, S.; Swerts, M.","The present study focused on the facial expressions that children exhibit while they try to deceive a virtual agent. An interactive lie elicitation game was developed to record children's facial expressions during deceptive and truthful utterances, when doing the task alone or in the presence of peers. Based on manual annotations of their facial expressions, we found that children, while communicating with a virtual agent, produce different facial expressions in deceptive and truthful contexts. It seems that deceptive children try to cover their lie as they smile significantly more than truthful children. Moreover, co-presence enhances children's facial expressive behaviour and the amount of cues to deceit.

74,9,23,Empathy for everyone? The effect of age when evaluating a virtual agent,"Hosseinpanah, A.; Krämer, N.C.; Stracmann, C.","The present study investigated the role of age in the perception of emotional nonverbal behaviors of a virtual assistant in a 2 (seniors vs young participants) x 2 (happy vs sad situations) x 4 (three emotional nonverbal behaviors related to each situation vs neutral behavior) mixed factorial design. In the study, a virtual agent acted as an assistant to review the imaginary monthly schedule of the participant. After uttering each schedule, the agent showed different emotional nonverbal behaviors to express empathy. The stimulus materials were presented to 60 participants (30 elderly people and 30 younger adults) in 25 videos. All participants had to rate the agents friendliness, intelligence, empathy, trustworthiness, and helpfulness immediately after watching each video. The results indicated that in the presence of the emotional nonverbal behaviors the elderly rated the agent as more empathic and trustworthy compared to the younger adults. The data also revealed that there were differences with respect to rating specific emotional nonverbal behaviors as more empathic than others.

75,9,37,How to make a robot smile? Perception of emotional expressions from digitally-extracted facial landmark configurations,"Liu, C.; Ham, J.; Postma, E.; Midden, Cees; Joosten, B.; Goudbeek, M.","To design robots or embodied conversational agents that can accurately display facial expressions indicating an emotional state, we need technology to produce those facial expressions, and research that investigates the relationship between those technologies and human social perception of those artificial faces. Our starting point is assessing human perception of core facial information: Moving dots representing the facial landmarks, i.e., the locations and movements of the crucial parts of a face. Earlier research suggested that participants can relatively accurately identity facial expressions when all they can see of a real human full face are moving white painted dots representing the facial landmarks (although less accurate than recognizing full faces). In the current study we investigated the accuracy of recognition of emotions expressed by comparable facial landmarks (compared to accuracy of recognition of emotions expressed by full faces), but now used face-tracking software to produce the facial landmarks. In line with earlier findings, results suggested that participants could accurately identify emotions expressed by the facial landmarks (though less accurately than those expressed by full faces).

76,9,43,Let the Avatar Brighten Your Smile: Effects of Enhancing Facial Expressions in Virtual Environments,"Oh, S.Y.; Bailenson, J.; Krämer, N.C.; Li, B.","Previous studies demonstrated the positive effects of smiling on interpersonal outcomes. The present research examined if enhancing one’s smile in a virtual environment could lead to a more positive communication experience. In the current study, participants’ facial expressions were tracked and mapped on a digital avatar during a real-time dyadic conversation. The avatar’s smile was rendered such that it was either a slightly enhanced version or a veridical version of the participant’s actual smile. Linguistic analyses using the Linguistic Inquiry Word Count (LIWC) revealed that participants who communicated with each other via avatars that exhibited enhanced smiles used more positive words to describe their interaction experience compared to those who communicated via avatars that displayed smiling behavior reflecting the participants’ actual smiles. In addition, self-report measures showed that participants in the ‘enhanced smile’ condition felt more positive affect after the conversation and experienced stronger social presence compared to the ‘normal smile’ condition. These results are particularly striking when considering the fact that most participants (>90%) were unable to detect the smiling manipulation.
