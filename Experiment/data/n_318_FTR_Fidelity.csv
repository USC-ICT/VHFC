1,Older Adults' Acceptance of Virtual Doctors: A Preliminary Investigation,"Sin, Jaisie Gi-Zin","The use of virtual doctors is increasing; yet, we have not fully studied their impact and how they are perceived by the public, especially by digitally-marginalized users such as older adults. We also do not know how virtual doctors compare to other technology-mediated alternatives, like traditional telemedicine. More broadly, the factors leading to older users’ adoption of virtual doctors are not well understood. In other similar fields, users’ perceptions of early generations of conversational interfaces have been extensively studied. This raises the question of how virtual agents’ fidelity (e.g. video vs. speech-only) and agency (e.g. human vs. machine) influence confidence, comfort, and ease of use in target groups like older adults. To fill these knowledge gaps, I have conducted a mixed-methods study with older adults in which they engaged with different versions of telemedicine setups. The versions varied along the dimensions of fidelity (e.g. video vs. speech-only) and agency (e.g. human vs. machine). Analysis of interview and survey data shows that older adults were most confident and comfortable with speech-only machine-powered interfaces for general healthcare information, and with video-based link with human doctors for specific healthcare information. The findings also show that in order for virtual doctor systems to be accepted by older adults, they need to do the following: complement older adults’ visits to their existing doctors, fit their existing information practices for gathering healthcare information, and have perceived value compared to their currently available alternatives.",2018,,,,,69,,,,#2721,Sin 2018,,
2,Supporting learner social relationships with enculturated pedagogical agents,"Ogan, Amy","Embodied conversational agents put a ""human"" touch on intelligent tutoring systems by using conversation to support learning. When considering instruction in interpersonal domains, such as intercultural negotiation, the development of an interpersonal relationship with one's pedagogical agent may play a significant role in learning. However, there is conflicting evidence in the literature both regarding the ability of agents to cultivate social relationships with humans, and their effect on learning. In this dissertation, I present a model of social dialog designed to affect learners' interpersonal relations with virtual agents, a development process for creating social dialog, and empirical studies showing that this dialog has significant effects on learners' perceptions of the agents and negotiation performance. In early work, I explicitly prompted learners to have social goals for the interaction. I found that while students who reported social goals for interacting with the agents had significantly higher learning gains, explicit prompting was not effective at inducing these goals. I thus focused on implicit influence of learner goals, developing a model of social instructional dialog (SID) that integrates conversational strategies that are theorized to produce interpersonal effects on relationships. In two subsequent studies, an agent with the SID model engendered greater feelings of entitativity, shared perspective, and trust, suggesting that the model improved learner social relationships with the agent. Importantly, these effects transferred to other agents encountered later in the environment. The social dialog condition also made fewer errors and achieved more negotiation objectives in a subsequent negotiation than a control group, evidence that the improved social relationship lead to better negotiation performance. These findings regarding interpersonal relationships with agents contribute to the literature on learner-agent interactions, and can guide the future development of agents in social environments.

3,Exploring the Uncanny Valley Effect in VR/AR,"Yan, Ting","This research is focused on the Uncanny Valley Effect of humanoid avatars, in a Virtual Reality (VR) /Augmented Reality (AR) environ- ment. We designed and conducted a user study to observe people’s reaction and behavior when interacting with virtual avatars of differ- ent levels of human likeness in VR and AR. Subjective surveys and objective measurement including EEG (Electroencephalogram), GSR (Galvanic Skin Response), Pupil Dilation sensors are used for quan- tification. Our result shows that, overall, in AR, people tend to like more human-like avatars, and users are more sensitive to facial expres- sions compared to body resemblance, especially on highly human like- ness avatars. Compared to traditional Uncanny Valley researches, we defined an additional factor in determining users’ experience, Avatar- Environment Contrast, the contrast between cartoonic characters and the real background. It plays a more significant role over other fac- tors, when avatars are far enough from users. In VR, contrary to AR, people show a more negative feeling towards more human-like avatars. We think the imperfections of the animations and character design are exaggerated when characters are more human-like, and when they are up close to users. In addition, we discussed the limitations of this study, and how the results from our results and other researchers could be applied on virtual character design, and finally, from a psychologi- cal perspective, how human perceive virtual characters with humanoid mind attributions.",2019,,,,,70,2320967051,,,#38089,Yan 2019,,
4,An Affect-Aware Dialogue System for Counseling,"Ring, Lazlo","Emotions play a key role in human-human communication. Because of our emotional understanding, we communicate empathic cues to others that act as foundations for building relationships and gaining trust. This is especially important in the healthcare domain, where empathy has been linked to improved doctor-patient relationships and stronger therapeutic bonds. However, as we move towards developing automated healthcare solutions, this rich channel of information can be lost.To address this lack of emotional understanding by computational interfaces, researchers have developed techniques to detect and respond to the user’s emotional state in real time. While research in emotion detection has achieved positive outcomes, the question of how automated systems could effectively use this information for empathic communication remains largely unanswered. Simple techniques such as mirroring back a user’s emotions have been shown to be unsuccessful, and almost none of this work being done in the healthcare domain.In this dissertation, I present a novel approach that allows computers to automatically adapt and respond to a user’s emotional state. Informed by an analysis of empathic communication in the context of human-human counseling, I develop a theoretical framework that integrates empathy into automated healthcare systems. I demonstrate how this framework can be applied to develop an automated depression counseling system, and evaluate its efficacy in a series of evaluation studies. In a longitudinal evaluation study with 36 participants, I compare an affect-aware version of the system against a conventional counseling system. Results show that participants received improved therapeutic care and had higher levels of system engagement using the affect-aware version.",2017,,,,,220,,,,#3110,Ring 2017,,
5,Applying human characteristics of trust to animated anthropomorphic software agents,"Green, Brian Daniel","Trust has profound effects on humans' interactions with one another as well as with automated technologies (Lee and See, 2004). A series of empirical studies conducted by Reeves and Nass (2002) suggest that humans interact with different forms of media guided by the same psychosocial principles as they do with other humans. It is suggested that because technology changes much more rapidly than our ability to adapt to new social systems that we consider all social interactions to be similar to an interaction with another human.The goal of the research conducted here was to identify likely physical and behavioral properties that have halo effects when humans interact with one another and apply them deliberately to autonomous anthropomorphic software agents. Three studies were developed and conducted to determine: (1) Can people readily interpret the characteristics of people typically associated with trust when applied to a software agent? (2) Will people consistently rate agents with more characteristics associated with trust as being trustworthier? And (3) what effect, if any, does altering these properties have on task performance?The first study utilized the Jian, Bisantz, and Drury (2000) Trust Scale to measure subjective levels of trust of a series of 120 agents. It was found that three design factors influenced these agent ratings: the type of agent character (referred to as normality of form), the amount of agent eye movement, and the shape of the agent's chin. A fourth factor, the distance between the eyes was found to have no effect on subjective trust ratings. An interaction effect between normality of form and eye movement was also found.Sixteen agents were selected from the 120 tested in the initial experiment studied levels of interest of the three significant factors. These agents were then presented to an independent sample in a paired comparisons experiment. Psychometric scaling of the results as described by Guilford (1954) revealed three levels of trustworthiness of the agents: Distrusted, Neutral, and Trusted. These groupings were confirmed by Dendrogram Analysis. GLM ANOVA confirmed that eye movement and normality of form were relevant factors, yet failed to confirm the findings of the first study with regards to Chin Shape.The final study investigated three agents from the second study as well as a non-anthropomorphic agent condition and a control condition to determine what role, if any, the appearance and reliability of the agent had on reading comprehension performance. A software program was developed in which agents appeared to read passages of text and provide visual feedback to the user regarding relevant (and sometimes) irrelevant content essential in successfully answering a series of reading comprehension questions. Performance ratings varied based on the agent appearance. In particular, the alien agent was least trusted in previous studies, actually influenced participants to have better performance than the other agents. It is likely that users disused this agent and defaulted to their own ability rather than relying upon this agent (Lee and See, 2004). It was the users superior ability compared to that of the agent that provided increased task performance.This document reviews the relevant preliminary research done by others and explains the rationale for the current studies. In addition, the research conducted for this dissertation is explained in detail. The results of the first and second study provide evidence that humans do in fact reliably and consistently apply properties of trust used in assessing humans to anthropomorphic agent designs. The results of the third study provide new evidence that humans tend to treat agents as if they were also human. Finally, the potential impact that the results may have in the areas of anthropomorphic agent design; trust of automation, and human factors engineering is discussed.

6,Effectiveness of Multimedia Pedagogical Agents Predicted by Diverse Theories: a Meta-Analysis,"Castro-Alonso, J.C.; Wong, R.M.; Adesope, O.O.; Paas, F.","Multimedia pedagogical agents are on-screen characters that allow users to navigate or learn in multimedia environments. Several agents’ characteristics may moderate their instructional effectiveness, including appearance, gender, nonverbal communication, motion, and voice. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis to test hypotheses from diverse theories predicting the effects of these agents’ characteristics. We tested predictions of cognitive load theory, cognitive theory of multimedia learning, computers are social actors, social agency theory, uncanny valley, and the action observation network. Our meta-analysis of 32 effect sizes (N = 2104) revealed a small overall effect (g+ = 0.20), showing that learning with multimedia pedagogical agents was more effective than learning without these agents. As predicted by the redundancy effect of cognitive load theory and the coherence principle of cognitive theory of multimedia learning, 2D agents (g+ = 0.38) tended to be more effective than 3D agents (g+ = 0.11). As predicted by the computers are social actors hypothesis, most of the agents’ characteristics, including nonverbal communication, motion, and voice, appeared not to moderate their effectiveness. We conclude that multimedia pedagogical agents help learning through multimedia, and that students may be able to learn similarly from different types of agents. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.",2021,,Educ.

7,Adding within-utterance emotion decay for more human-like dialog,"Durcholz, Michael Hans","While spoken dialog systems have been used for commercial applications for several decades, most commercial spoken dialog systems provide only simple information exchange capabilities. Emotion synthesis in spoken dialog systems has become an active research area recently, and use of emotion-adaptive dialog systems has demonstrated improvements in user experience and rapport. This thesis seeks to improve how emotions are conveyed in dialog systems to enable robust emotional support that improves user experiences with dialog systems and models human speech characteristics more accurately than current dialog systems.     Prior work with Gracie (GRAduate Coordinator with Immediate response Emotions), an emotion-adaptive dialog system, enabled system utterances that conveyed emotional qualities based on the perceived emotional state of the user. This feature improved the user experience with the dialog system through increased rapport. However, Gracie was able to convey only a constant emotion during a conversation turn, regardless of the length of the turn. This thesis extends Gracie to modify the emotional qualities of system utterances on a sub-turn level.     In the study carried out in this thesis, the emotional coloring was varied on a sub-turn level by linearly attenuating the emotional qualities so that they reached a neutral emotional state at the utterance end. Evaluation with 36 subjects showed that they significantly preferred conversing with the version of Gracie that supports sub-turn emotional coloring over the original Gracie. Subjects also tended to rate the sub-turn coloring Gracie system as more human-like than the original system.",2012,,,,,84,1022985362,,,#45766,Durcholz 2012,,
8,Agents that care: Investigating the effects of orientation of emotion exhibited by an embodied computer agent,"Brave, Scott Brenner","Embodied computer agents are becoming an increasingly popular human-computer interaction technique. Often, these agents are programmed with the capacity for emotional expression. This dissertation investigates the psychological effect of emotion in agents upon users. In particular, two types of emotion were evaluated: self-oriented emotion and other-oriented, empathic emotion. Empathic emotion was found to lead to more positive ratings of the agent by users, consistent with the hypothesis that empathic emotion is inferred to reflect caring for the user. No such effect was found for the presence of self-oriented emotion.Experiment 1 compared an agent exhibiting both self-oriented and empathic emotion to an agent exhibiting self-oriented emotion only in a 2 (empathic emotion: absent vs. present) by 2 (gender dyad: male vs. female) between-subjects experiment (N = 48). Significant main effects demonstrated that the presence of empathic emotion increased users' ratings of the agent's likability, trustworthiness, and caring. In addition, caring was found to be a significant mediator of the effect of empathic emotion on both likability and trustworthiness.To ensure that the effects of empathic emotion were not due to emotion more generally, and to investigate the potential moderating effect of self-oriented emotion, Experiment 2 additionally investigated the effect of self-oriented emotion in a 2 (self-oriented emotion: absent vs. present) by 2 (empathic emotion: absent vs. present) by 2 (gender dyad: male vs. female) between-subjects experiment (N = 96). Empathic emotion was found to have a significant effect on the agent's likability, trustworthiness, and perceived caring, as well as on the user's felt support, independent of the presence of self-oriented emotion. The presence of self-oriented emotion was found to have no such effects. Implications for the design of embodied computer agents are discussed and directions for future research are suggested.",,,,,,132,,,,#2620,,Andrew Leeds (2022-04-02 10:55:06)(Select): Borderline.

9,The world is not enough: Trust in cognitive agents,"de Visser, Ewart Jan","Models describing human-automation interaction propose that trust in machines is uniquely different from trust in humans. Alternatively, some claim these differences disappear if machines are designed in likeness of humans. With the advent of cognitive agents, entities that are neither machine nor human, this dichotomous distinction may no longer be appropriate. Four experiments were designed to examine these opposing viewpoints directly by varying the humanness of agents on a cognitive-agent spectrum. In a controlled version of an automated decision-aid paradigm, agents provided recommendations on a pattern recognition task. Results showed that in early trials, compliance was higher with machine-like agents compared to human-like agents. This difference disappeared as familiarity with agents increased. When agents were portrayed as competitive, trust and compliance decreased for human-like agents compared to cooperative human-like agents, but no such differences were observed between machine-like agents. Immediate trial-by-trial performance feedback resulted in more appropriate trust and compliance compared to delayed cumulative performance feedback. Humane feedback that was either encouraging on high performance trials and apologetic in low performance trials resulted in higher compliance with agents compared to sessions without such feedback. These findings suggest that differences between cognitive agents are strong in novel, ambiguous situations, but disappear with direct performance observations. Decision aids may require a machine-like design if high performance can be guaranteed, but may need to exhibit human-like features when the outcome is uncertain and initial expectations need to be lowered. This work presents a step towards a general human-agent trust theory that can account for observed differences between types of agents.",2012,,,,,103,1080969747,,,#57156,deVisser 2012,Andrew Leeds (2022-04-02 05:00:27)(Select): Study 1 and 4 of most relevance; study 3 personality characteristics.; ,
10,The impact of pedagogical agent gesturing in multimedia learning environments: A meta-analysis,"Davis, Robert O.","A meta-analysis consisting of 20 experiments (N = 3841) on the influence of pedagogical agent (PA) gesturing in multimedia environments revealed that gestures have a small-to-medium impact on near transfer of knowledge (g = 0.39), retention of learning (g = 0.28), and agent persona (g = 0.44), but a minimal impact on reducing cognitive load (g = 0.13). Moderator analysis discovered that humanoid agents had a small effect on decreasing cognitive load (g = 0.24), while character agents had a minimal to small effect on increasing cognitive load (g = - 0.18). Interestingly, a deeper analysis found that the differences in effect sizes for near transfer and retention might be due to the learning outcome measured and not the design of the PA. Overall, the findings revealed that PA gestures are beneficial for student learning and perception in multimedia learning environments.",2018,,Educational Research Review,24,,193-209,,10.1016/j.edurev.2018.05.002,,#5695,Davis 2018,,
11,Embodied Conversational Agents: Effects on memory performance and anthropomorphisation,"Beun, Robbert-Jan; De Vos, Eveliene; Witteman, Cilia","It is often assumed that the use of Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs) in human-computer interfaces improves human-computer interaction. Because of their appearance and because they show human-like communicative behaviour, users tend to ascribe human characteristics to ECAs or 'anthropomorphize' them. Since interacting with another human being comes natural to people, anthropomorphisation of agents in an interface is thought to improve the process of communication. As a result, other usability aspects, such as satisfaction and learnability, would probably benefit. This paper describes a study into anthropomorphisation of ECAs and their effect on memory performance. The results of our study show that the presence of an ECA has a positive effect on retainability of information, but that this effect is not necessarily influenced by anthropomorphism.",2003,,,2792,,315-319,,10.1007/978-3-540-39396-2_52,,#1584,Beun 2003,,
12,Linguistic and Gestural Adaptation,"Hu, Zhichao","Human conversants in dialog adjust their behavior to their conversational partner in many ways. In terms of language, they adapt to their partners both lexically and syntactically, by using the same referring expressions or sentence structure. In terms of gesture, they mimic their partners' gestural form, frequency, expanse and speed. However, adaptation is not about simply copying dialog partners' words, syntax, and gestures. The process of adaptation to the partner takes place under other special constraints, e.g. providing coherent and informative turns in conversation, expressing one's own personality, or achieving other social and interpersonal goals. How do speakers adapt to one another and at the same time achieve their own conversational goals?In this thesis, we first carry out an exploratory study to show that adapting to different linguistic features results in different style perceptions: adapting to hedges increase perceptions of friendliness, while adapting to syntactic structures increases perceptions of naturalness. On the basis of these results, we propose an adaptation measure that allows us to capture and model adaptation behaviors that may orient to different levels or types of linguistic representations, such as lexical, syntactical, or stylistic variations in the way speakers talk. We build and compare linguistic adaptation models using our measure with four human dialog corpora, and with different feature sets to represent different levels of linguistic representations.We also explore gestural adaptation on both particular gesture forms and gesture style. We set up our experiment in the form of two virtual gents co-telling a story. We first verify that we can express the personality of virtual agents through varying gesture parameters such as speed, height, and expanse. We then show that human subjects prefer adaptive to nonadaptive virtual agents, where the adaptive virtual agent adapts the gesture form and personality of their dialog partner.",2018,,,,,134,,,,#2506,Hu 2018,Andrew Leeds (2022-04-01 10:40:03)(Select): Most relevant section: 5.2.2 Experiment 2: Gestural Adaptation.

However, it is unclear if users prefer an embodied to a speech-only agent for augmented reality (AR) headsets that are designed to assist users in completing real-world tasks. We conducted a study to examine users' perceptions and behaviors when interacting with virtual agents in AR. We asked 24 adults to wear the Microsoft HoloLens and find objects in a hidden object game while interacting with an agent that would offer assistance. We presented participants with four different agents: voice-only, non-human, full-size embodied, and a miniature embodied agent. Overall, users preferred the miniature embodied agent due to the novelty of his size and reduced uncanniness as opposed to the larger agent. From our results, we draw conclusions about how agent representation matters and derive guidelines on designing agents for AR headsets.",2019,,Proceedings of the 2019 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,,,12-Jan,,,,#584,Wang 2019,,
15,Experimental evaluation of affective embodied agents in an information literacy game,"Guo, Y.R.; Goh, D.H.-L.; Muhamad, H.B.H.; Ong, B.K.; Lei, Z.","Digital game-based learning (DGBL) has become increasingly popular. With elements such as narratives, rewards, quests, and interactivity, DGBL can actively engage learners, stimulating desired learning outcomes. In an effort to increase its appeal, affective embodied agents (EAs) have been incorporated as learning companions or instructors in DGBL. However, claims about the efficacy of using affective EAs in DGBL have scarcely been subjected to empirical analysis. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the influence of affective EAs on students' learning outcome, motivation, perceived usefulness, and behavioral intention in an information literacy (IL) game. Eighty tertiary students were recruited and randomly assigned in a pre- and post-test between-subjects experiment with two conditions: affective-EA and no-EA. Results showed that participants benefited from interacting with the affective EA in the IL game in terms of attention, confidence, satisfaction, and intention to learn IL knowledge and to recommend. However, there were no significant differences in learning outcome, relevance, or intention to play the game.

Both were represented by a humanoid avatar in the shared 3D environment. The visual appearance of the avatars was either basic and genderless (like a ""match-stick"" figure), or more photorealistic and gender-specific. Similarly, eye gaze behavior was either random or inferred from voice, to reflect different levels of behavioral realism.Our comparative analysis of 48 post-experiment questionnaires confirms earlier findings from non-immersive studies using semi-photorealistic avatars, where inferred gaze significantly outperformed random gaze. However responses to the lower-realism avatar are adversely affected by inferred gaze, revealing a significant interaction effect between appearance and behavior.

The agent simulates two attention-grabbing mechanisms - humorous and serious to attract the users' attention. A formal study was conducted to compare two tour guide applications in the lab. The data collected from the facial expression analysis and eye-tracking helped to explain particularly good and bad performances in retention tests. In terms of the study results, strong quantitative and qualitative evidence was found that an ECA should not attract more attention to itself than necessary, to avoid becoming a distraction from the flow of the content. It was also found that the ECA had an inverse effect on the retention performance of participants with different gender and their use on computer interfaces is not a good idea for elderly users.",2014,,,,,27-32,,10.1145/2666642.2666650,,#739,Doumanis 2014,"Andrew Leeds (2022-03-08 11:53:58)(Select): More characteristic focused than fidelity.

23,An approach to integrating emotion in dialogue management,"Yuan, Xiaobu","Presented in this paper is a method for the construction of emotion-enabled embodied (conversational) agents. By using a modified POMDP model, this method allows dialogue management not only to include emotion as part of the observation of users actions, but also to take systems response time into consideration when updating belief states. Consequently, a novel algorithm is created to direct conversation in different contextual control modes, whose dynamic changes further provide hints for emotion animation with facial expressions and voice tunes. Experiment results demonstrate that the integration of emotion in dialogue management makes embodied agents more appealing and yields much better performance in human/computer interaction.

24,Embedding Conversational Agents into AR: Invisible or with a Realistic Human Body?,"Reinhardt, Jens; Hillen, Luca; Wolf, Katrin","Currently, (invisible) smart speech assistants, such as Siri, Alexa, and Cortana, are used by a constantly growing number of people. Moreover, Augmented Reality (AR) glasses are predicted to become widespread consumer devices in the future. Hence, smart assistants can easily become common applications of AR glasses, which allows for giving the assistant a visual representation as an embodied agent. While previous research on embodied agents found a user preference for a humanoid appearance, research on the uncanny valley suggests that simply designed humanoids can be favored over hyper-realistic humanoid characters. In a user study, we compared agents of simple versus more realistic appearance (seen through AR glasses) versus an invisible state-of-the-art speech assistants (see Figure 1). Our results indicate that a more realistic visualization is preferred as it provides additional communication cues, such as eye contact and gaze, which seem to be key features when talking to a smart assistant. But if the situation requires visual attention, e.g., when being mobile or in a multitask situation, an invisible agent can be more appropriate as they do not distract the visual focus, which can be essential during AR experiences.",2020,,,,,299-310,,10.1145/3374920.3374956,,#572,Reinhardt 2020,,
25,Effects of Social Touch from an Agent in Virtual Space: Comparing Visual Stimuli and Virtual-Tactile Stimuli,"Higashino, K.; Kimoto, M.; Iio, T.; Shimohara, K.; Shiomi, M.","Although social touch in physical space has been scrutinized for its positive effects on people, the effects of social touch in virtual space has been neglected. In virtual space, two types of social touch can be designed, a touch with only visual stimuli and a touch with both visual and tactile stimuli. This paper investigates the effects of the two types of agent's social touch on users in the context where the agent praises their performance of a task in virtual space. Based on past studies of social touch, we hypothesized that the two types of agent's social touch in virtual space would improve the user's task motivation, task performance, and the agent's likability. We experimentally tested our hypotheses by comparing those variables among no-touch, visual-touch, and visual-tactile touch groups. Since our results showed no significant differences among these groups, our hypotheses were not supported. However, a post-hoc analysis by gender suggests that the agent's social touch with both visual and tactile stimuli while praising male users increased their task motivation in virtual space. This result suggests that the effects of an agent's social touch in virtual space may be different due to genders, and shows a possibility of positive effects for the touch behavior design of the agent in virtual space. © 2020 IEEE.",2020,,"29th IEEE International Conference on Robot and Human Interactive Communication, RO-MAN 2020",,,768-774,,10.1109/RO-MAN47096.2020.9223333,,#23584,Higashino 2020,,

However, these reminders often represent a task interruption for users who are engaged in work activities. This paper presents the results of a study which explores strategies for interrupting users at work to perform a healthy behavior, in which the primary outcome of interest is long-term adherence to a desired health behavior change regimen. We find that the degree of perceived politeness of interruptions is positively correlated with predicted long-term adherence, but negatively correlated with short-term compliance. We also find that, among several interruption coordination strategies previously explored in the literature, empathic interruptions are superior overall in gaining both short-term compliance and long-term adherence.",2007,,Persuasive Technology,4744,,11-Jan,,,,#6417,Bickmore 2007,,

28,Participant responses to virtual agents in immersive virtual environments,"Vinayagamoorthy, Vinoba","This thesis is concerned with interaction between people and virtual humans in the context of highly immersive virtual environments (VEs). Empirical studies have shown that virtual humans (agents) with even minimal behavioural capabilities can have a significant emotional impact on participants of immersive virtual environments (IVEs) to the extent that these have been used in studies of mental health issues such as social phobia and paranoia. This thesis focuses on understanding the impact on the responses of people to the behaviour of virtual humans rather than their visual appearance. There are three main research questions addressed. First, the thesis considers what are the key nonverbal behavioural cues used to portray a specific psychological state. Second, research determines the extent to which the underlying state of a virtual human is recognisable through the display of a key set of cues inferred from the behaviour of real humans. Finally, the degree to which a perceived psychological state in a virtual human invokes responses from participants in immersive virtual environments that are similar to those observed in the physical world is considered. These research questions were investigated through four experiments. The first experiment focused on the impact of visual fidelity and behavioural complexity on participant responses by implementing a model of gaze behaviour in virtual humans. The results of the study concluded that participants expected more life-like behaviours from more visually realistic virtual humans. The second experiment investigated the detrimental effects on participant responses when interacting with virtual humans with low behavioural complexity. The third experiment investigated the differences in responses of participants to virtual humans perceived to be in varying emotional states. The emotional states of the virtual humans were portrayed using postural and facial cues. Results indicated that posture does play an important role in the portrayal of affect however the behavioural model used in the study did not fully cover the qualities of body movement associated with the emotions studied. The final experiment focused on the portrayal of affect through the quality of body movement such as the speed of gestures. The effectiveness of the virtual humans was gauged through exploring a variety of participant responses including subjective responses, objective physiological and behavioural measures. The results show that participants are affected and respond to virtual humans in a significant manner provided that an appropriate behavioural model is used.",2006,,,,,322,1428562225,,,#56108,Vinayagamoorthy 2006,,
29,Evaluating humanoid embodied conversational agents in mobile guide applications,"Doumanis, Ioannis","Evolution in the area of mobile computing has been phenomenal in the last few years. The exploding increase in hardware power has enabled multimodal mobile interfaces to be developed. These interfaces differ from the traditional graphical user interface (GUI), in that they enable a more “natural” communication with mobile devices, through the use of multiple communication channels (e.g., multi-touch, speech recognition, etc.). As a result, a new generation of applications has emerged that provide human-like assistance in the user interface (e.g., the Siri conversational assistant (Siri Inc., visited 2010)). These conversational agents are currently designed to automate a number of tedious mobile tasks (e.g., to call a taxi), but the possible applications are endless. A domain of particular interest is that of Cultural Heritage, where conversational agents can act as personalized tour guides in, for example, archaeological attractions. The visitors to historical places have a diverse range of information needs. For example, casual visitors have different information needs from those with a deeper interest in an attraction (e.g., - holiday learners versus students). A personalized conversational agent can access a cultural heritage database, and effectively translate data into a natural language form that is adapted to the visitor’s personal needs and interests. The present research aims to investigate the information needs of a specific type of visitors, those for whom retention of cultural content is important (e.g., students of history, cultural experts, history hobbyists, educators, etc.). Embodying a conversational agent enables the agent to use additional modalities to communicate this content (e.g., through facial expressions, deictic gestures, etc.) to the user. Simulating the social norms that guide the real-world human-to-human interaction (e.g., adapting the story based on the reactions of the users), should at least theoretically optimize the cognitive accessibility of the content. Although a number of projects have attempted to build embodied conversational agents (ECAs) for cultural heritage, little is known about their impact on the users’ perceived cognitive accessibility of the cultural heritage content, and the usability of the interfaces they support. In particular, there is a general disagreement on the advantages of multimodal ECAs in terms of users’ task performance and satisfaction over nonanthropomorphised interfaces. Further, little is known about what features influence what aspects of the cognitive accessibility of the content and/or usability of the interface. To address these questions I studied the user experiences with ECA interfaces in six user studies across three countries (Greece, UK and USA). To support these studies, I introduced: a) a conceptual framework based on well-established theoretical models of human cognition, and previous frameworks from the literature. The framework offers a holistic view of the design space of ECA systems b) a research technique for evaluating the cognitive accessibility of ECA-based information presentation systems that combine data from eye tracking and facial expression recognition. In addition, I designed a toolkit, from which I partially developed its natural language processing component, to facilitate rapid development of mobile guide applications using ECAs. Results from these studies provide evidence that an ECA, capable of displaying some of the communication strategies (e.g., non-verbal behaviours to accompany linguistic information etc.) found in the real-world human guidance scenario, is not affecting and effective in enhancing the user’s ability to retain cultural content. The findings from the first two studies, suggest than an ECA has no negative/positive impact on users experiencing content that is similar (but not the same) across different locations (see experiment one, in Chapter 7), and content of variable difficulty (see experiment two, in Chapter 7). However, my results also suggest that improving the degree of content personalization and the quality of the modalities used by the ECA can result in both effective and affecting human-ECA interactions. Effectiveness is the degree to which an ECA facilitates a user in accomplishing the navigation and information tasks. Similarly, affecting is the degree to which the ECA changes the quality of the user’s experience while accomplishing the navigation and information tasks. By adhering to the above rules, I gradually improved my designs and built ECAs that are affecting. In particular, I found that an ECA can affect the quality of the user’s navigation experience (see experiment three in Chapter 7), as well as how a user experiences narrations of cultural value (see experiment five, in Chapter 8). In terms of navigation, I found sound evidence that the strongest impact of the ECAs nonverbal behaviours is on the ability of users to correctly disambiguate the navigation of an ECA instructions provided by a tour guide system. However, my ECAs failed to become effective, and to elicit enhanced navigation or retention performances. Given the positive impact of ECAs on the disambiguation of navigation instructions, the lack of ECA-effectiveness in navigation could be attributed to the simulated mobile conditions. In a real outdoor environment, where users would have to actually walk around the castle, an ECA could have elicited better navigation performance, than a system without it. With regards to retention performance, my results suggest that a designer should not solely consider the impact of an ECA, but also the style and effectiveness of the question-answering (Q&A) with the ECA, and the type of user interacting with the ECA (see experiments four and six, in Chapter 8). I found that that there is a correlation between how many questions participants asked per location for a tour, and the information they retained after the completion of the tour. When participants were requested to ask the systems a specific number of questions per location, they could retain more information than when they were allowed to freely ask questions. However, the constrained style of interaction decreased their overall satisfaction with the systems. Therefore, when enhanced retention performance is needed, a designer should consider strategies that should direct users to ask a specific number of questions per location for a tour. On the other hand, when maintaining the positive levels of user experiences is the desired outcome of an interaction, users should be allowed to freely ask questions. Then, the effectiveness of the Q&A session is of importance to the success/failure of the user’s interaction with the ECA. In a natural-language question-answering system, the system often fails to understand the user’s question and, by default, it asks the user to rephrase again. A problem arises when the system fails to understand a question repeatedly. I found that a repetitive request to rephrase the same question annoys participants and affects their retention performance. Therefore, in order to ensure effective human-ECA Q&A, the repeat messages should be built in a way to allow users to figure out how to ask the system questions to avoid improper responses. Then, I found strong evidence that an ECA may be effective for some type of users, while for some others it may be not. I found that an ECA with an attention-grabbing mechanism (see experiment six, in Chapter 8), had an inverse effect on the retention performance of participants with different gender. In particular, it enhanced the retention performance of the male participants, while it degraded the retention performance of the female participants. Finally, a series of tentative design recommendations for the design of both affecting and effective ECAs in mobile guide applications in derived from the work undertaken. These are aimed at ECA researchers and mobile guide designers.",2013,,,,,1,,,,#3025,Doumanis 2013,Andrew Leeds (2022-04-13 15:53:52)(Select): Experiment Five  204; ,
30,Designing computer agents with personality to improve human -machine collaboration in complex systems,"Prabhala, Sasanka","The dynamic nature of complex systems and the overwhelming amount of data that must be handled by human operators requires the development of smart systems that augment human capabilities. For these systems human-agent collaboration is part of the system dynamic. Unfortunately the computer agent is not typically perceived by the human operator as a collaborative team member.    This research addressed the key question of how to develop and evaluate computer agents with personality to enhance human-machine collaboration. To move towards this goal three research objectives were established: (1) develop agents with personality, (2) validate that humans perceive these agents as having a personality, and (3) evaluate if agents with personality enhance human-machine collaboration.    Experimentation and development was carried out in three phases:  Phase I: Identify actions, language, and/or behaviors that signify personality traits within a well known personality model (Big Five Factor). Participants rated personality traits and identified actions, language and behaviors that gave them their impressions. Phase II: Model agents in a multimodal environment and validate the personalities. Actions, language and behaviors were modeled into computer agents via visual, auditory, and tactile output supporting a uninhabited combat aerial vehicle (UCAV) military mission. Phase III: Empirically evaluate human-machine collaboration performance when using agents in a complex semi-autonomous UCAV mission.    Empirical results indicated that humans were able to identify and perceive significant actions, language, and/or behaviors associated with the computer agent personalities modeled. In addition, human performance (overall simulation score) was significantly greater when interacting with agents having a personality versus an agent with no personality.    This research has made a significant contribution to the field of human-machine collaboration by (a) outlining a systematic approach based on modern personality theory for developing computer agents with personality and incorporating personality theory into model development, (b) developing a foundation for an agent personality model by providing methods to capture actions, language, and behaviors that can be used in agent models, (c) identifying significant personality traits that can be modeled in the context of collaboration/teamwork, (d) evaluating whether computer agents that communicate personality via multimodal inputs provide users with perception of personality.",2007,,,,,172,304716807,,,#49038,Prabhala 2007,,
31,Virtually bad: A study on virtual agents that physically threaten human beings: Socially interactive agents track,"Bosse, T.; Hartmann, T.; Otte, M.; Blankendaal, R.A.M.; Goedschalk, L.; Dokter, N.","This paper introduces the concept of ""virtual bad guys"": intelligent virtual agents that take a negative or even aggressive stance towards the user. Although they pave the way to various interesting applications, it is hard to create virtual bad guys that are taken seriously by the user, since they are typically unable to apply serious sanctions. To address this issue, this study experimentally investigated the effect of ""consequential"" agents that are able to physically threaten their human interlocutors. A consequential agent was developed by equipping users with a (non-functioning) device, through which they were made to believe the agent could mildly shock them. Effects on participants' levels of anxiety and (physiological and self-reported) stress were measured, and the role of presence and perceived believability of the virtual agent was assessed. The consequential agent triggered a stronger physiological stress response than the non- consequential agent, whereas self-reported levels of anxiety and stress did not significantly differ. Furthermore, while presence and believability were substantially associated with users' stress response, both states did not mediate or explain the effect of a consequential vs. non-consequential agent on stress, as they did not significantly differ between conditions.

33,"Mixed reality interpersonal simulation affords cognitive, psychomotor, and affective learning","Kotranza, Aaron Andrew","We introduce a new approach to interpersonal simulation—mixed reality interpersonal simulation (MRIPS). MRIPS incorporates passive and active haptic interfaces instrumented with sensors to afford touch between human and virtual human as well as the manipulation of hand-held tools. Thus, in addition to bidirectional verbal and gestural capabilities of traditional interpersonal simulation, MRIPS provides touch from human to virtual human, touch from virtual human to human, and touch from hand-held tools to virtual human. These touch inputs and outputs are used to affect the psychomotor, cognitive, and affective components of the simulated interpersonal scenario.    The incorporation of these haptic interaction capabilities in MRIPS addresses problems with prior approaches to interpersonal simulation, expanding the applicability of interpersonal simulation to training cognitive, psychomotor, and affective skills and their concurrent use: (1) Problem. Psychomotor task components involving touch could not be simulated. (a)  Approach. MRIPS incorporates touch from human to virtual human and from hand-held tool to virtual human to afford the simulation of psychomotor task components involving touch. (2) Problem. Prior interpersonal simulation approaches do not afford touch for communication between the human and virtual human. Touch is an essential component of communication between two humans and the lack of touch results in incomplete communication in these interpersonal simulators. (a) Approach. By incorporating touch from human to virtual human and from virtual human to human, MRIPS affords interpersonal communication to accomplish both cognitive task components, e.g. achieving compliance in getting a patient to assume a specific pose for a physical exam, and affective components, e.g. a comforting touch. (3)  Problem. Prior approaches to interpersonal simulation afforded only simple vision-based gesture interfaces, e.g. pointing and iconic gestures, or encumbering gesture interfaces, e.g. body suits. (a) Approach. MRIPS incorporates instrumentation, e.g. six degree-of-freedom tracking, of the haptic interfaces. This affords simulation of handheld tools for performing complex psychomotor task components not involving touch. These tools also serve as grounding objects to enhance communication between the human and virtual human. (4) Problem. Feedback and reflection motivated by feedback is necessary for learning. Prior interpersonal simulations could not provide feedback of psychomotor performance without encumbering interfaces, e.g. gloves, body suits or expert observers. (a) Approach. MRIPS incorporates instrumentation of the non-encumbering haptic interfaces for touching the virtual human and for tool manipulation. This affords quantitative measuring of the learner’s psychomotor, cognitive, and affective skills performance as well as real-time feedback to guide and elicit reflection on the learner’s performance. By providing realtime feedback of learner performance, MRIPS increases the potential for learning in the simulated interpersonal scenario.    We applied MRIPS to simulate two interpersonal scenarios in medicine—the clinical breast exam and the neurological exam—which could not be simulated through prior interpersonal simulation approaches. User studies established the validity of MRIPS for practicing and evaluating learners’ psychomotor, cognitive, and affective skills. We then incorporated visual feedback of user performance in these three skill sets, to enhance the potential for learning. Additional user studies were then conducted to determine what learning occurs in users of MRIPS and whether skills learned in MRIPS transfer to the real-world scenarios being simulated.    Results show that MRIPS affords psychomotor, cognitive, and affective learning required for success in real-world interpersonal scenarios and that skills learned in MRIPS translate to the real world scenarios. This work demonstrates the validity of using MRIPS to train real-world interpersonal scenarios and motivates further incorporation of MRIPS into interpersonal skills curricula.

34,Embodied Agents for Long-Term Interaction,"Schulman, Daniel","An Embodied Conversation Agent (ECA) is a computer interface designed to simulate human face-to-face conversation with its users, through the production of synthesized or prerecorded speech combined with an humanoid embodiment: a representation, either physical or visual, of a body capable of producing some portion of the nonverbal behaviors associated with speech, such as mouth movements, eye movements, head movements, hand gestures, facial expressions, and body posture. A key research problem in the design and implementation of realistic ECAs is generating the range of verbal and nonverbal behavior present in human conversation with appropriate frequency, timing, and quality.ECAs have been used in a variety of applications, motivated by their potential to leverage the affordances of face-to-face conversation to build trust and engagement with users, and their learnability given their use of universally understood communicative cues. Many applications, including education and counseling, are examples of long-term interaction; where an effective agent must have many conversations, over a long period of time, while building rapport with its users. However, prior work on realistic conversational behavior for ECAs has focused heavily on single conversations, isolated from any larger context. To the extent that human conversational behavior is not fixed and unchanging across multiple conversations with the same conversation partner, this approach risks producing ECAs with behavior that becomes increasingly unrealistic in long-term interaction.In this thesis, I present an approach to designing ECAs with realistic verbal and nonverbal behavior in long-term interaction. Based on a longitudinal corpus of health behavior change counseling dialogue, containing multiple conversations between several counselor-client dyads, I construct a series of statistical models demonstrating systematic changes in human conversational behavior across multiple conversations; these changes are predicted both by the interaction history of a dyad, and by the strength or quality of their interpersonal relationship. Based on these findings, I present a model and implementation of verbal and nonverbal behavior generation for ECAs which reproduces some of the observed behavior patterns. Finally, I present a longitudinal randomized controlled evaluation study demonstrating that the resulting model of behavior generation, implemented in an ECA that acts as a virtual health behavior change counselor, produces measurable improvements in user-agent interpersonal bond in long-term interaction.",2013,,,,,348,,,,#3100,Schulman 2013,Andrew Leeds (2022-04-13 10:28:35)(Select): 8  Evaluation  119; ,

Also common to a typical person's daily life is persuasion. Whether being persuaded or persuading, the ability to change another person's attitude or behavior is a thoroughly researched topic. However, little is known about ECAs' ability to persuade and whether basic persuasion principles from human-human interactions will hold in human-ECA interactions. This work investigates this question.First, a broad review of persuasion literature, which serves as an inventory of manipulations to test in ECA contexts, is presented. This literature review serves an inventory to guide future Persuasive ECA work. The ECA literature is then reviewed. Two preliminary studies exploring the effects of physical attractiveness, voice quality, argument quality, common ground, authority, and facial similarity are presented. Finally, the culminating study testing the effectiveness of ECAs to elicit self-disclosure in automated interviewing is presented and discussed. The findings of that automated interviewing study suggest that ECAs may replace humans in automated interviewing contexts.

36,Social Perception of Pedestrians and Virtual Agents Using Movement Features,"Randhavane, Tanmay","In many tasks such as navigation in a shared space, humans explicitly or implicitly estimate social information related to the emotions, dominance, and friendliness of other humans around them. This social perception is critical in predicting others’ motions or actions and deciding how to interact with them. Therefore, modeling social perception is an important problem for robotics, autonomous vehicle navigation, and VR and AR applications.In this thesis, we present novel, data-driven models for the social perception of pedestrians and virtual agents based on their movement cues, including gaits, gestures, gazing, and trajectories. We use deep learning techniques (e.g., LSTMs) along with biomechanics to compute the gait features and combine them with local motion models to compute the trajectory features. Furthermore, we compute the gesture and gaze representations using psychological characteristics. We describe novel mappings between these computed gaits, gestures, gazing, and trajectory features and the various components (emotions, dominance, friendliness, approachability, and deception) of social perception. Our resulting data-driven models can identify the dominance, deception, and emotion of pedestrians from videos with an accuracy of more than 80%. We also release new datasets to evaluate these methods.We apply our data-driven models to socially-aware robot navigation and the navigation of autonomous vehicles among pedestrians. Our method generates robot movement based on pedestrians’ dominance levels, resulting in higher rapport and comfort. We also apply our data-driven models to simulate virtual agents with desired emotions, dominance, and friendliness.

37,Deploying Affect-Inspired Mechanisms to Enhance Agent Decision-Making and Communication,"Antos, Dimitrios","Computer agents are required to make appropriate decisions quickly and efficiently. As the environments in which they act become increasingly complex, efficient decision-making becomes significantly more challenging. This thesis examines the positive ways in which human emotions influence people's ability to make good decisions in complex, uncertain contexts, and develops computational analogues of these beneficial functions, demonstrating their usefulness in agent decision-making and communication.     For decision-making by a single agent in large-scale environments with stochasticity and high uncertainty, the thesis presents GRUE (Goal Re-prioritization Using Emotion), a decision-making technique that deploys emotion-inspired computational operators to dynamically re-prioritize the agent's goals. In two complex domains, GRUE is shown to result in improved agent performance over many existing techniques.     Agents working in groups benefit from communicating and sharing information that would otherwise be unobservable. The thesis defines an affective signaling mechanism, inspired by the beneficial communicative functions of human emotion, that increases coordination. In two studies, agents using the mechanism are shown to make faster and more accurate inferences than agents that do not signal, resulting in improved performance. Moreover, affective signals confer performance increases equivalent to those achieved by broadcasting agents' entire private state information.     Emotions are also useful signals in agents' interactions with people, influencing people's perceptions of them. A computer-human negotiation study is presented, in which virtual agents expressed emotion. Agents whose emotion expressions matched their negotiation strategy were perceived as more trustworthy, and they were more likely to be selected for future interactions.     In addition, to address similar limitations in strategic environments, this thesis uses the theory of reasoning patters in complex game-theoretic settings. An algorithm is presented that speeds up equilibrium computation in certain classes of games. For Bayesian games, with and without a common prior, the thesis also discusses a novel graphical formalism that allows agents' possibly inconsistent beliefs to be succinctly represented, and for reasoning patterns to be defined in such games. Finally, the thesis presents a technique for generating advice from a game's reasoning patterns for human decision-makers, and demonstrates empirically that such advice helps people make better decisions in a complex game.",2012,,,,,254,1027762809,,,#47417,Antos 2012,Andrew Leeds (2022-04-12 08:52:12)(Select): See experiment in Chapter 4.; ,
38,The use of animated agents in *surveys,"Lind, Laura Hahn","The social presence of a human interviewer can affect respondents' answers to sensitive questions, causing them to overreport socially desirable behaviors and underreport socially undesirable ones. Self-administration methods such as Audio Computer Self-Interviewing (ACASI) can mitigate some problems associated with interviewer-administration, but human interviewers have been shown to be better at eliciting certain kinds of information from respondents, as well as increasing respondents' willingness to participate in and complete a survey. The study reported here explores whether new technologies for human-looking virtual interviewers could potentially combine the benefits of both self-administration and interviewer-administration, or whether human-looking virtual interviewers embody the worst of both kinds of data collection. In a laboratory experiment, 235 respondents answered threatening questions either with a human interviewer face to face (FTF), or by clicking in a web browser with one of three self-administered modes: a virtual interviewer designed to include a high number of social cues (i.e. facial movements and expressions), a virtual interviewer with minimal social cues, or via ACASI. The results indicate that the presence of social cues in the virtual interviewers interact with the type and degree of question sensitivity. For example, when asking respondents to report their number of lifetime sex partners, the highly expressive virtual interviewer elicited answers similar to what was seen in the FTF interview (fewer partners) while the minimally expressive virtual interviewer elicited answers similar to what was found with ACASI (more partners). However, when respondents were asked to describe their weight, which could be visually confirmed by a human interviewer, respondents interacting with the highly expressive virtual interviewer described their weight as lower than those who participated in the FTF interview, presumably understanding that the virtual interviewer couldn't see them. Overall, the results indicate that the virtual interviewers sometimes produce social presence effects and sometimes don't, depending on the way in which, and the degree to which, a given question is sensitive.",2008,,,,,142,,,,#2318,Lind 2008,"Andrew Leeds (2022-04-12 08:19:05)(Select): Most relevant seems the comparison of ""virtual interviewer designed to include a high number of social cues"" and ""virtual interviewer with minimal social cues.""; ",
39,Effective Tutoring with Empathic Embodied Conversational Agents,"Moyo, Sharon G.","This thesis examines the prospect of using empathy in an Embodied Tutoring System (ETS) that guides students through an online quiz (by providing feedback on student answers and responding to self-reported student emotion). The ETS seeks to imitate human behaviours successfully used in one-to-one human tutorial interactions. The main hypothesis is that the interaction with an empathic ETS results in greater learning gains than a neutral ETS, primarily by encouraging positive and reducing negative student emotions using empathic feedback.In a preparatory study we investigated different strategies for expressing emotion by the ETS. We established that a multimodal strategy achieves the best results regarding how accurately human participants can recognise the emotions. This approach was used in developing the feedback strategy for our empathic ETS.The preparatory study was followed by two studies in which we compared a neutral with an empathic ETS. The ETS in the second of these studies was developed using results from the first of these studies. In both studies, we found no statistically significant difference in learning gains between the neutral and empathic ETS. However, we did discover a number of interactions between the ETS system, learning gains and, in particular 1) student scores on an empathic tendency test and 2) student ability. We also analysed the subjective responses and the relation between self-reported emotions during the quiz and student learning gains.Based on our studies in a formal classroom setting, we assess the prospects of using empathic agents in a classroom setting and describe a number of requirements for their effective use.",2014,,,,,249,,,,#3011,Moyo 2014,,
40,The persuasiveness of humanlike computer interfaces varies more through narrative characterization than through the uncanny valley,"Patel, Himalaya","Just as physical appearance affects persuasion and compliance in human communication, it may also affect the processing of advice conveyed through avatars, computer-animated characters, and other computer interfaces. Although the most persuasive interfaces are often the most humanlike, they incur the greatest risk of falling into the uncanny valley, the loss of empathy associated with eerily human characters. Previous studies have compared interfaces on the left side of the uncanny valley, namely, those with low human likeness. To examine interfaces with higher human realism, two between-groups factorial experiments were conducted through the Internet. The first experiment involved 426 Midwestern US undergraduate students. This experiment presented a hypothetical ethical dilemma followed by the advice of an authority figure. The authority was manipulated in three ways: depiction (recorded human or animated avatar), motion quality (smooth or jerky), and recommendation (disclose or refrain from disclosing sensitive information). Of these, only the recommendation changed opinion about the ethical dilemma, even though the animated depiction was significantly eerier than the human depiction. These results indicate that compliance with an authority persists even when using an uncannily realistic computer-animated double. The uncanny valley also predicts that humanlike agents with nonhuman features will be evaluated negatively. However, it is unclear whether this effect persists across differently framed interactions. A second (posttest-only) experiment was conducted with 311 Midwestern US undergraduates. Participants were assigned one of two novel dilemmas in professional ethics involving the fate of a humanlike agent. In addition to the dilemma, there were three 2-level manipulations of the agent's human realism: depiction (animated human or humanoid robot), voice (recorded or synthesized), and motion (smooth or jerky). In one dilemma, decreasing depiction realism or increasing voice realism increased eeriness. In the other dilemma, increasing depiction realism decreased perceived competence. In both dilemmas human realism had no significant effect on whether to punish the agent. Instead, the willingness to punish was predicted most reliably by the agent's narratively framed autonomy and credibility, demonstrating strong effects of narratives on responses to humanlike agents. Though perceptible in humanlike interfaces, the uncanny valley's effect on persuasiveness is attenuated by contextual information.",2014,,,,,184,,,,#2817,Patel 2014,"Andrew Leeds (2022-04-08 05:37:04)(Select): Study 2 - Limited interaction, 1-minute video at end.

41,Lifelike agents in e -commerce: A study of humanness in interface agents,"Jettmar, Eva","As animated on-screen characters become increasingly lifelike, one question pertains to the effects of human-likeness in interface agents. Lifelike agents can differ from humans in several ways: First, ontologically (being an actual human vs. being computer-generated); second, looking human (looking exactly like a person vs. looking computer-generated); and third, displaying appropriate human-like behaviors (behaving socially human vs. behaving computerlike). This study focused on how these dimensions of humanness affect each other in highly lifelike agents. Two competing theories were utilized to predict the effects of combining human and non-human qualities in interface agents: Consistency theory states that consistency of traits leads to higher levels of positive affect, predicting that ""purely"" human-like or computer-like agents will elicit greater positive affect than agents displaying mixed traits. Alternatively, the independent maximization paradigm predicts a simple preference for higher quality agents, regardless of trait inconsistencies.A 2 (ontologically human vs. computer-generated) x 2 (human-looking vs. computer-looking) x 2 (human-like [nonverbally immediate] behavior vs. computer-like [nonverbally flat] behavior) experiment (N = 48) was conducted to determine the effects of different combinations of human-like and computer-like traits on users' perceptions of highly lifelike agents and buying behavior in an e-commerce context.Significant main effects for nonverbal immediacy underscored the importance of this trait regardless of ontology and physical appearance. Interaction effects indicated that for a computer-generated agent, both human- and computer-like traits are acceptable, while for a human agent, only human-like traits lead to favorable evaluations.Overall, consistency theory was supported. For an ontologically human agent, human-like behavior led to favorable attitudes about the agent, while in several instances, for the computer-generated agent, computer-like physical appearance led to more favorable evaluations, pointing to users' preferences for trait-consistent characters. In addition, when the agent was a computer-generated agent or looked like one, a lack of positive nonverbal cues was considered more acceptable, while a human or human-looking agent was only evaluated positively when displaying appropriate positive nonverbal cues. Directions for future research are suggested and implications for designing lifelike agents are discussed.",2006,,,,,172,,,,#2606,Jettmar 2006,Andrew Leeds (2022-04-07 15:52:55)(Select): Stimulus consisted of manipulated footage of a real person to appear and sound as if computer generated.

42,Designing social interactions with animated avatars and speech output for product recommendation agents in electronic commerce,"Qiu, Lingyun","Product Recommendation Agents (PRAs) and other web-based decision aids are deployed extensively by online vendors, to provide virtual advising services to their customers. While the design of PRA functionality has received increasing amount of attention in academic studies, the social aspects of human-PRA interactions are comparatively less studied. This dissertation investigates the potential of enhancing users' social experiences with PRAs by developing and analyzing an anthropomorphic interface, which has humanoid embodiment and voice output.This dissertation first investigates the importance of choosing appropriate demographic embodiments for a humanoid PRA. The two demographic variables that have been assessed are ethnicity and gender. As suggested by similarity-attraction theories and social-identity theories, results of a laboratory experiment have revealed that users apply similar social stereotypes in human-human communications as they apply to evaluate humanoid agents. PRAs that match the ethnicity of users are perceived by the users as more sociable, more competent, and more enjoyable to interact with than PRAs that do not match users' ethnicity; as well, same-gender PRAs are perceived as more competent and more honest than opposite-gender agents. In addition, the ""match-up"" effects of ethnicity appear to be more significant among female users than among males.Two interface components are also empirically investigated in this dissertation: (1) presence of a humanoid embodiment and (2) output modalities (text, computer-synthesized voice, or human voice). Results from a laboratory experiment demonstrate that humanoid embodiments increase consumers' perception of a PRA's social presence, their beliefs in its competence, and the enjoyment they derive from interaction with the PRA. A human voice also appears to be significantly more effective than on-screen text and computer-synthesized voice in improving the PRA's perceived social presence and enjoyment.Furthermore, the important role of social relationships in influencing user adoption of agents is tested by integrating social presence, trust, and perceived enjoyment with the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Social presence appears to be a common antecedent of both trust and perceived enjoyment. Trust exerts a direct impact on user intentions to adopt PRAs, as well as an indirect impact via user perceptions of PRAs' usefulness. Perceived enjoyment also influences adoption intentions through perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use.",2006,,,,,176,,,,#2731,Qiu 2006,"Andrew Leeds (2022-04-07 10:03:09)(Select): Relevant study: CHAPTER 5: INFLUENCES OF PRA’S HUMANOID

43,Examining direct and indirect social influence with virtual characters,"Zanbaka, Catherine Amine","With the emergence of interface agents and virtual characters in everyday applications, understanding how people respond to this new medium is crucial. The research presented in this dissertation examines peoples' responses to virtual characters by applying principles from the field of social psychology to study human-virtual human interactions. This dissertation presents empirical results from a series of experiments investigating how people react to and are influenced by virtual characters.    The first two experiments examine indirect social influence by drawing on the social facilitation/inhibition paradigm from the field of social psychology. Social facilitation/inhibition theory states that when in the presence of others, people perform simple or learned tasks better and complex or novel tasks worse. The results from these experiments showed participants were inhibited by the presence of others, whether real or virtual.    The final experiment examined direct social influence by drawing on the  persuasion paradigm from the field of social psychology. The results indicated that the virtual speakers were as effective at changing attitudes as real people.    The overall conclusion is that people do respond similarly to virtual characters as they respond to real people. And surprisingly, gender plays a more significant role than realism in how people respond to virtual characters.",2007,,,,,174,304744243,,,#37465,Zanbaka 2007,,
44,Pairing Media-Captured Human Versus Computer-Synthesized Humanoid Faces and Voices for Talking Heads: A Consistency Theory for Interface Agents,"Gong, Li","Talking heads are an emerging form of interface agent. An essential question for designing a talking head is how to pair media-captured human versus computer-synthesized humanoid faces and voices. A consistency theory for interface agents is formulated based on the psychological literature on perception, personality perception, and processing of communication cues. The consistency theory argues for pairing a human face with a human voice and a humanoid face with a humanoid voice.Experiment One compared the two practical talking-head options (a humanoid face with a humanoid voice or with a human voice) in a 2 (humanoid face vs. no face) x 2 (humanoid voice vs. human voice) between-subjects experiment (N = 48) in the context of users' self-disclosure. Significant interaction effects demonstrated that the humanoid face with the humanoid voice (consistent) elicited greater amount of disclosure and more intimate disclosure from participants than the humanoid face with the human voice (inconsistent though independently maximized).To provide a complete test of consistency and examine the role of the user's gender, Experiment Two built upon Experiment One with a 2 (human face vs. humanoid face) x 2 (human voice vs. humanoid voice) x 2 (male vs. female users) between-subjects design (N = 80). To investigate the role of context, Experiment Two replicated the task of self-disclosure and added a comprehension-driven task of listening to book reviews on a simulated e-commerce Web-site. The results provided strong support for the consistency hypothesis with two modifications: (1) talking heads with a consistent face-voice pairing obtained more positive attitudinal responses from the users, obtained more positive task outcomes for the disclosure task, and required less time on task than talking heads with an inconsistent face-voice pairing; (2) the human voice achieved more positive task outcomes for the e-commerce task than the humanoid voice, overwhelming the face-voice consistency effect and indicating the importance of context; and (3) females showed stronger attitudinal preference for face-voice consistency and more negative reactions to the humanoid face and voice. Directions for future research and implications for designing talking heads are suggested.",2001,,,,,146,,,,#2069,Gong 2001,,
45,Norm awareness for virtual characters behaviour : a socio-cognitive approach,"Lee, JeeHang","Social intelligence has a huge impact on the determination of human behaviour in the society. The use of norms can contribute to advances in this social intelligence by the provision of appropriate behaviour based upon the understanding of social situations. Hence, the domain of virtual characters research has given much attention to take advantage of these characteristics of norms particularly in engineering human-like behaviour. However, a lack of capability in reasoning about norms as well as a lack of norm autonomy in virtual characters have significantly diminished the naturalism in virtual characters behaviour. Within this context, a hybrid approach incorporating social and individual reasoning inspired by socio-cognitive theory is taken into account in this thesis. To this end, we propose DNA 3 , Distributed Norm Aware Agent Architecture, established through the integration of (i) the institution, a normative framework performing the social reasoning, (ii) N-Jason, a (BDI-type) cognitive agent carrying out run-time norm-aware deliberation and (iii) a virtual character in charge of perception and realisation of actions. The institution takes responsibility of (i) analysis of state of external worlds by recording a sequence of event occurrences observed by multiple virtual agents, (ii) reasoning about situationally appropriate behaviour with an assistance from Answer Set Programming (ASP) solver depending upon the social context virtual characters encounter and (iii) in turn detachment of a new set of norms, more precisely normative consequences of specific actions, to virtual characters. This contributes to the enhancement in the flexibility in specifying and reasoning about social norms subject to changes of social situations. Those detached norms are involved in the reasoning process of in- dividual virtual characters. In here, a norm-aware BDI-type agent, N-Jason, performs a practical reasoning to select a plan to execute between norms and goals. Basically, N-Jason offers a generic norm execution mechanism on top of norm aware deliberation to contribute to the exploitation of run-time norm compliance. The selection of agent behaviour is achieved in the norm-aware deliberation process by intention scheduling with deadlines and priorities. This improves the rationality in the choice of behaviour with taking into account the preference on norms and goals in agent mind by evaluation of the importance and imminence between feasible plans triggered by both norms and goals. The design and simulation of politeness is presented as an evaluation of DNA 3 with respect to the effectiveness and adequacy in modelling virtual characters behaviour. The emphasis in here lies on the capability that is able to exhibit different types of appropriate polite behaviour in response to frequent changes in social situations. This is mainly driven by two main activities: prediction of other participants’ intention is carried out by norm-aware virtual characters whilst the understanding of context and reasoning about relevant social behaviour is performed in normative frameworks. For this purpose, three case studies are provided in this thesis: (i) politeness in navigation of individuals, (ii) politeness in the formation and navigation of groups during a guided tour, and(iii) evacuation model as a politeness in the emergency situation. The evaluation is conducted by measuring: (i) the appropriateness of in response to scenarios (e.g.a number of avoiding collisions) and (ii) the reliability of agent decision making (e.g. a response time in relation to norms with the highest priority and the most urgent).",2015,,,,,,1784056944,,,#56689,Lee 2015,"Andrew Leeds (2022-04-07 08:00:34)(Select): Borderline.

46,Analysis of Gesture Frequency and Amplitude as a Function of Personality in Virtual Agents,"Rayon, Alex Michael","Embodied conversational agents are changing the way humans interact with technology. Agents are expected to behave like people, both verbally and non-verbally. Researchers within the Human-Computer Interaction community have found many attributes of an agent’s gesture contribute to an agent’s perceived personality and believability.Gesture amplitude and frequency are two of the attributes that contribute to the naturalness of a gesture. Currently, no previous studies have defined an empirical baseline for generating natural gestures for these two attributes. I seek to discover whether gesture amplitude and frequency affect how users perceive an agent’s naturalness, and which gestures would be preferred for an agent based on its personality.In particular, I seek to quantify gesture amplitude and to compare it to a previous study on the perception of an agent’s naturalness of its gestures. In this thesis, non-verbal gesturing consists of movement of the arms and their location in space. I evaluate whether agents should use specific gestures more frequently than others depending on the personality type they have been designed with. My study is organized into three experiments and evaluations. My results show some indication that introverts and extraverts judge the agent’s naturalness similarly. The larger the amplitude the agent used, the more natural its gestures were perceived. The frequency of gestures between extraverts and introverts seem to show hardly any difference, even in terms of types of gesture used.",2017,,,,,50,,,,#3113,Rayon 2017,"Andrew Leeds (2022-04-06 06:50:32)(Select): Study 1 most applicable; however, limited interaction, as participants only reviewed a set of video clips of a virtual character gesturing w/o dialogue.; ",

Two experiments were conducted to examine PALS' affect separately in terms of affective expression and response. 142 students in a computer literacy course participated in Experiment I, which examined the effects of PALs' affective expression (positive vs. negative vs. neutral) and gender (male vs. female). 56 pre-service teachers participated in Experiment II, which examined the effects of PALS' affective response (responsive vs. non-responsive) and gender (male vs. female).The results revealed the significant effect of PAL affective expression on agent persona: Students who worked with the positive or neutral PALS perceived agent persona more positively than students who worked with the negative PAL (p < .05). Second, PALs' affective response significantly influenced interest and self-efficacy: Students who worked with the PAL that responded to their affect showed significantly higher interest (p < .05) and self-efficacy beliefs (p < .05) than students who worked with the non-responsive PAL. Third, PALS' gender significantly affected learning, interest, and agent persona: Students who worked with a male PAL recalled more (p < .01) and were more interested in the task and the PAL (p < .05) in Experiment I. This positive impact of a male PAL was consistent on learners' perceptions of PAL persona in Experiment II (p < .05). Lastly, there was a significant interaction effect between PAL affective expression and gender on agent persona in Experiment I (p <.05): When the PALs expressed positive affect, the male PAL's persona was perceived more positively than the female PAL's; however, this interaction was minimal when the PALs expressed negative or neutral affect. This interaction trend was also appeared for learner interest in Experiment I.Overall, PALs' affect and gender influenced learners' affective and cognitive characteristics as real human teachers or peers did (Wong & Dornbusch, 2000). Given this finding, researchers can design the gender and affect of PALs appropriately in the way that facilitates learning and motivation in computer-based environments.",2004,,,,,155,,,,#2448,Kim 2004,Andrew Leeds (2022-04-05 09:56:11)(Select): Borderline; fidelity most applicable to presence of affective expression and affective response in each respective study.; ,

Prior studies have already demonstrated that feelings like bonding toward the agent occur within a long-term usage.</br> As from human-human interaction it can be derived that the appearance of interlocutors is important for the development interpersonal relationships; this dissertation investigated the role of appearance in terms of social relations. Moreover, the impact of the aimed target-group was focused, since applications in terms of health or assistance are promising application fields for specific target groups such as seniors.</br> Therefore, an empirical approach consisting out of four different studies was used. Results from qualitative interviews (Study 1) indicate valuable insights about target-group-related differences. Students indicate that they perceive the agent more as a technical entity and want prevent from social processes that an agent might evoke. In contrast, seniors seem to value the familiarity of a humanoid appearance, since they like to address an interlocutor and assume a humanoid appearance to trigger trust and bonding. This was partly supported by Study 2, which demonstrated that seniors rely more on species and students on realism. In an actual interaction between human and agent (Study 3), the results for seniors have been substantiated. Seniors benefit from social outcomes of a humanoid appearance, as a humanoid agent was also found to trigger higher usage intention, trust and bonding for seniors, while this is not the case for students. Hence, seniors seem to be more sensitive for appearance cues than students, who might relay more on functions. However, also for students appearance was found to have promising effects. In Study 4 an attractive agent was more liked and enhanced users’ intention to live healthy.</br> Although no development of appearance effects over times have been found, still the evaluation of the agent and users’ closeness towards the agent seem to change over time. This might be useful to foster the usage of virtual agents and their effectiveness. Altogether, this work makes valuable contribution to research regarding appearance effects: (1) appearance variables have been categorized and investigated in a more systematic manner, (2) the impact of user characteristics has been examined, (3) appearance effects have been investigated over time and with regard to an interpersonal relationship between the user and the agent.</br> To conclude, the agent’s appearance can especially enhance a longitudinal human-agent interaction for seniors, but also for students, whose evaluation is less affected by the agent’s appearance, beneficial outcomes have been found (e.g., enhancement of health intention).; ",
49,A framework to enhance and research the interactional capabilities and instructional potential of virtual characters and pedagogical agents,"Veletsianos, George","How can humans communicate effectively with computers? Human-like virtual characters are becoming increasingly popular in a world where online education is widespread. Yet, when human learners interact with digital characters employed in educational settings, termed pedagogical agents, learners often become impatient, disenchanted, and frustrated. Albeit researchers have already made disjointed attempts to enhance the interactional capabilities of virtual characters such that they appear polite, friendly, and knowledgeable, this dissertation is a compilation of three concentrated and convergent studies aimed at enhancing the interaction between learners and virtual characters.    The EnALI framework of guidelines that designers and researchers can use to minimize conflicts between learners and virtual characters is proposed in chapter two. The framework is grounded on previous work that indicates that learners interact with agents in an inherently social manner and that guidelines on enhancing interaction and collaboration between humans can be adapted to provide insight into how communication between learners and agents can be improved.    Chapter three investigates one of the guidelines proposed in the EnALI framework. Specifically, when pedagogical agents interact with learners they appear to focus exclusively on the content that is to be taught. While content is crucial to learning, I propose that the interjection of extraneous information during agent-learner interaction may enhance learning with virtual characters. Results from a mixed methods study indicate that the inclusion of extraneous information may enhance learning and agent-learner interactions while the continuous addition of off-topic items harms learning and interaction. Focus group discussions intended to contextualize the experimental results indicated the complex nature of agent-learner relationships.    The EnALI framework also proposes that agent expressiveness may improve the interaction between pedagogical agents and learners, ultimately enhancing learning outcomes. This hypothesis is examined in chapter four. Evidence from a mixed methods study, indicates that learners who interacted with a verbally expressive agent (a) scored higher on a post-task exam, and (b) rated the agent's ability to interact higher, than learners who interacted with a non-expressive agent. Qualitative results provided insight into this finding, while revealing the multifaceted nature of pedagogical agent integration in educational settings.",2008,,,,,122,304533297,,,#47437,Veletsianos 2008,,
50,Persuasive interactive non-verbal behaviour in embodied conversational agents,"Shearer, John","Realism for embodied conversational agents (ECAs) requires both visual and behavioural fidelity. One significant area of ECA behaviour, that has to date received little attention, is non-verbal behaviour. Non-verbal behaviour occurs continually in all human-human interactions, and has been shown to be highly important in those interactions. Previous research has demonstrated that people treat media (and therefore ECAs) as real people, and so non-verbal behaviour is also important in the development of ECAs. ECAs that use non-verbal behaviour when interacting with humans or other ECAs will be more realistic, more engaging, and have higher social influence. This thesis gives an in-depth view of non-verbal behaviour in humans followed by an exploration of the potential social influence of ECAs using a novel Wizard of Oz style approach of synthetic ECAs. It is shown that ECAs have the potential to have no less social influence (as measured using a direct measure of behaviour change) than real people and also that it is important ECA's have visual feedback on their interactants for this social influence to maxiimised. Throughout this thesis there is a focus on empirical evaluation of ECAs, both as a validation tool and also to provide directions for future research and development. Present ECAs frequently incorporate some form of non-verbal behaviour, but this is quite limited and more importantly not connected strongly to the behaviour of a human interactant. This interactional aspect of non-verbal behaviour is important in humanhuman interactions and results from the study of the persuasive potential of ECAs support this fact mapping onto human-ECA interactions. The challenges in creating nonverbally interactive ECAs are introduced and by drawing corollaries with robotics control systems development behaviour-based architectures are presented as a solution towards these challenges, and implemented in a prototypical ECA. Evaluation of this ECA using the methodology used previously in this thesis demonstrates that an ECA with non-verbal behaviour that responds to its interactant is rated more positively than an ECA that does not, indicating that directly measurable social influences will be possible with further development.",2009,,,,,1,,,,#3047,Shearer 2009,,
51,Social responses to virtual humans: The effect of human-like characteristics,"Park, Sung","A framework for understanding the social responses to virtual humans suggests that human-like characteristics (e.g., facial expressions, voice, expression of emotion) act as cues that lead a person to place the agent into the category ""human"" and thus, elicit social responses. Given this framework, this research was designed to answer two outstanding questions that had been raised in the research community (Moon & Nass, 2000): (1) If a virtual human has more human-like characteristics, will it elicit stronger social responses from people? (2) How do the human-like characteristics interact in terms of the strength of social responses? Two social psychological (social facilitation and politeness norm) experiments were conducted to answer these questions. The first experiment investigated whether virtual humans can evoke a social facilitation response and how strong that response is when participants are given different cognitive tasks (e.g., anagrams, mazes, modular arithmetic) that vary in difficulty. They did the tasks alone, in the company of another person, or in the company of a virtual human that varied in terms of features. The second experiment investigated whether people apply politeness norms to virtual humans. Participants were tutored and quizzed either by a virtual human tutor that varied in terms of features or a human tutor. Participants then evaluated the tutor's performance either directly by the tutor or indirectly via a paper and pencil questionnaire. Results indicate that virtual humans can produce social facilitation not only with facial appearance but also with voice recordings. In addition, performance in the presence of voice synced facial appearance seems to elicit stronger social facilitation (i.e., no statistical difference compared to performance in the human presence condition) than in the presence of voice only or face only. Similar findings were observed with the politeness norm experiment. Participants who evaluated their tutor directly reported the tutor's performance more favorably than participants who evaluated their tutor indirectly. In addition, this valence toward the voice synced facial appearance had no statistical difference compared to the valence toward the human tutor condition. The results suggest that designers of virtual humans should be mindful about the social nature of virtual humans.",2009,,,,,85,,,,#2672,Park 2009,,

While most of the work on the uncanny valley is focused on finding a way to surpass the uncanny valley and how certain things could be designed to increase or decrease the uncanniness of an animation, this paper investigates how removing certain blendshapes from the facial animation changes our perception about the eeriness of that animation. The goal is to identify the “necessary” blendshapes which bring about a significant change the perceived uncanniness of the animation. For achieving this, participants undergo visual tests which entails observing short animated clips expressing different emotions and recording the human-likeness and uncanniness, as perceived by the observers.

54,The Impact of Animated Pedagogical Agent Gestures on Agent Social Acceptance and Learning Outcomes with Elementary School Foreign Language Students,"Davis, Robert Otto","Animated pedagogical agents (APAs) are lifelike characters in computer-based environments that help to facilitate learning through social interactions (Son, 2014). APAs are useful when designing multimedia presentations because of the flexibility with agent design, the ability to perform multiple roles, and the affordance to be manually manipulated for better learning opportunities. However, one area that has been sparsely researched to date with APAs is the act of gesturing. APA studies routinely use deictic gestures, but ignore the potential role of iconic, beat, and metaphoric gestures. If APAs are to simulate human-like interaction, then APAs need to incorporate deictic, iconic, metaphoric, and beat gestures into their speech. This study examined APAs in three conditions: full gestures, deictic only gestures, and no gesture conditions. In the full gesture condition, the APA was designed to use body sway, facial expressions, eye blinks, lip synchronization, and a variety of gestures such as deictic, iconic, metaphoric, and beat gestures. The deictic only gesture condition used body sway, facial expressions, eye blinks, and lip synchronization, but only used deictic gestures – to replicate the common gesture design of APAs. The no gesture control condition included body sway, facial expressions, eye blinks, and lip synchronization, but all gestures were eliminated.Social acceptance was measured by the completion of the Korean agent persona instrument (Ryu, 2012) and analyzed with a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). No significant difference was found in learning outcomes across conditions. However, APAs in the full gesture condition supported the person effect as they were found to be significantly more human-like and engaging than APAs in the no gesture condition. Stepwise multiple regression analysis found evidence that social acceptance factors “human-like” and “engaging” had negative associations with learning outcome scores. This research provides evidence that APAs with full gesture capabilities have the ability to increase social perception by learners.",2017,,,,,143,,,,#2470,Davis 2017,,
55,Virtual humans and photorealism: The effect of photorealism of interactive virtual humans in clinical virtual environment on affective responses,"Chaturvedi, Himanshu","The ability of realistic vs stylized representations of virtual characters to elicit emotions in users has been an open question for researchers and artists alike. We designed and performed a between subjects experiment using a medical virtual reality simulation to study the differences in the emotions aroused in participants while interacting with realistic and stylized virtual characters. The experiment included three conditions each of which presented a different representation of the virtual character namely; photo-realistic, non-photorealistic cartoon-shaded and non-photorealistic charcoal-sketch. The simulation used for the experiment, called the Rapid Response Training System was developed to train nurses to identify symptoms of rapid deterioration in patients. The emotional impact of interacting with the simulation on the participants was measured via both subjective and objective metrics. Quantitative objective measures were gathered using skin Electrodermal Activity (EDA) sensors, and quantitative subjective measures included Differential Emotion Survey (DES IV), Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), and the co-presence or social presence questionnaire. The emotional state of the participants was analyzed across four distinct time steps during which the medical condition of the virtual patient deteriorated, and was contrasted to a baseline affective state. The data from the EDA sensors indicated that the mean level of arousal was highest in the charcoal-sketch condition, lowest in the realistic condition, with responses in the cartoon-shaded condition was in the middle. Mean arousal responses also seemed to be consistent in both the cartoon-shaded and charcoal-sketch conditions across all time steps, while the mean arousal response of participants in the realistic condition showed a significant drop from time step 1 through time step 2, corresponding to the deterioration of the virtual patient. Mean scores of participants in the DES survey seems to suggest that participants in the realistic condition elicited a higher emotional response than participants in both non-realistic conditions. Within the non-realistic conditions, participants in the cartoon-shaded condition seemed to elicit a higher emotional response than those in the charcoal-sketch condition.",2015,,,,,61,1757725398,,,#56030,Chaturvedi 2015,,

To improve the efficacy of the interaction between humans and ECAs, I focus on the development of rapport, which is a complex and extensive behavioral state of affinity, synchronicity, coordination and mutual understanding that is difficult to model, measure and interpret. I present our AGENT Framework and our ECA, Adriana, which is capable of speech recognition and gesture recognition over long periods of time. Our current system provides up to 60 minutes of human-ECA interaction in a jungle-survival scenario. The benefits of rapport often fall outside of conscious awareness.

58,Toward Intelligent Animated Tutoring Systems: Monitoring of Student Comprehension Through Facial Expression Classification,"Agada, Ruth O.","Recognition of spontaneous emotion would influence human-computer interaction and emotion-related studies in many related fields. In any given environment, the spontaneous generation of expression are more often observed than their prototypic counterparts.This thesis explores methods for detecting emotional facial expressions occurring in a tutor-tutee setting -- the expressions made by the tutee to non verbally communicate understanding. Given the importance of non-verbal communication in human dialog, the information gathered will in turn be used to inform the agent on user understanding of material and be able to provide a more realistic relationship between a tutor and the tutee.Considering that in-class teaching time is very limited, it can be very challenging for an educator to instruct the student, while keeping the student’s interest in the course high throughout the semester. This requires innovation in teaching, especially when the class is large. The affect sensitive animated tutoring system is designed to simulate the process of one-to-one tutoring of small class teaching and helping educators to further supplement the contents to suit the needs of the students. The intelligence of the embodied agent system comes from information related to the student knowledge, the specific domain knowledge, and the teaching strategies, but also the affective state of the student and the role it plays in helping the student progress through the curriculum. In this research, we put forth an affect sensitive emotionally capable animated tutoring system for introduction to programing courses, providing the student the opportunity to learn about certain aspects of the course. Key instruction modules based on core concepts in programing will be created in which the student is presented with a lecture specified by the instructor, as well topics to be covered in that lecture. Based on the subtopic selected by the student, only information pertinent to that subtopic is displayed. As the session proceeds the system will monitor the student for affective feedback via any spontaneous facial expression generation. Once a negative affect is detected the embodied agent will then assess the student to determine the root of the affect ad devise a strategy to help the student progress from the negative affect to a positive one. Also, following each lecture, quizzes will be made available to test the students’ comprehension and retention of the lecture. The quiz modules test students on information covered in each lecture module.Three issues were evaluated in the analyses: the comprehension level of the user after interacting with the system, the user’s perception of their learning experiences as a result of the embedded animated agent and the affective visualization of the different learning states. Preliminary results show that the condition in which the agent is fully expressive shows a marked increase in the level of comprehension because as we speculated the user is more invested in the software when the agent fully articulates emotion through head movement and facial expression. In addition, the condition in which the agent is partially animated illustrates that the comprehension level is the average of both the fully animated and non-animated agent.",2016,,,,,144,,,,#2661,Agada 2016,Andrew Leeds (2022-04-01 16:55:19)(Select): Impact of virtual tutor on student via post-test scores and affective design: 94; Arno Hartholt (2022-03-11 05:21:46)(Select): Experiment 3; ,
59,Increasing the credibility of anthropomorphic computer characters: The effects of manipulating nonverbal interaction style and demographic embodiment,"Cowell, Andrew James","The present study examined the efficacy of enhancing human-agent interaction through the use of nonverbal behaviors. A taxonomy was created, which organizes nonverbal behaviors into functional categories, including adaptors, regulators, affect displays, illustrators, and emblems. The taxonomy further divided these behaviors by the manner in which they can be embodied (i.e., through gesture, posture, paralanguage, eye contact and facial expression). The influences of demographic variables (i.e., ethnicity, age and gender) and physical appearance (i.e., bodily and facial attractiveness, clothing and artifacts) were also considered. Forty participants were presented with computer characters that varied in terms of their ethnicity, age, and gender and asked which they would prefer to cooperate with on a computer task. The results indicated that in general youthful agents of similar ethnicity were preferred but there was no clear gender preference. In the main empirical study anthropomorphic computer characters were endowed with different levels of nonverbal behavior known to engender a trusting persona. The first level provided facial expressions, eye contact, and paralanguage. The second level added to these behaviors bodily gestures and posture. A third embodiment engendered an agent with non-trusting behaviors. Based on the results of the pilot study, the characters were youthful and selected to match each participant's ethnicity, while the gender of the agent was left open to participant's choice. It was hypothesized that those agents with the first level of nonverbal behaviors would be perceived as more credible than an anthropomorphic computer character without such attributes. Adding the second level of nonverbal behaviors was expected to result in further gains, while the non-trusting agent embodiment was suggested to be ineffective. A between subjects experimental design was used, in which forty-eight female participants interacted with one of the four computer characters that assisted them in sorting photographs. The results indicated that participants that interacted with computer characters endowed with facial expressions, eye contact, and paralanguage perceived these characters as being more trustworthy and satisfying to interact with than those who interacted with an anthropomorphic character with no nonverbal behaviors.

60,Identifying and exploring factors affecting embodied conversational agent social presence for interpersonal skills training,"Chuah, Joon Hao","Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) have been used as virtual conversational partners in interpersonal skills training applications such as medical interviews, military decision making, and cultural training. Ideally, in interpersonal skills training users will perceive and treat the ECAs the same as they would real people. The perception and treatment of ECAs as real people is known as social presence. This dissertation identifies and explores approaches to increase an ECAs social presence. One approach is to use mixed reality technology to bring the ECA into the physical space and increase its physicality. Three studies were run on physicality. The first two suggested that increasing an ECAs occupancy of the physical space can elicit more realistic treatment of the ECA. These studies also suggested there may be interaction effects between physicality and plausibility, and also matching levels of physicality are important. The third study suggested increasing an ECAs interaction with the physical space does not have an effect on social presence. A qualitative study was also run to identify other factors affecting social presence. This study suggested factors related to an ECAs plausibility, including what the ECA says and how it responds, also affect social presence. This study also emphasized the importance of a user’s expectations and how those can affect social presence.

61,Social Cues in Animated Pedagogical Agents for Second Language Learners: The Application of the Embodiment Principle in Video Design,"Alyahya, Sahar M.","This study investigated the involvement of the Social Agency Theory within a multimedia learning environment to improve English language proficiency. The primary aim of this study is to find the effects of designing language learning instructional videos following the embodiment principle on language learners’ motivation, cognitive load and performance in production of the target language. According to Social Agency Theory, when multimedia learning includes social cues like an on-screen agent with humanlike features (e.g., hand gestures, body movements, eye contact, and facial expressions), the quality of learning will be increased. To examine the effect of the embodiment principle, the study designed three different videos in which three different levels of the embodiment principle were applied: a high-embodied agent (HEA), a low-embodied agent (LEA), and voice-only agent (VOA). Then, a comparison of the three videos was made, which in turn served as a comparison of the effectiveness of the embodiment principle when applied to an agent in instructional videos. Participants were recruited from the preparatory year program—a college year with a concentration in English language courses that precedes the English Language and Literature program. Data on cognitive load, motivation, and grammatical performance were collected online using several instruments to answer the three research questions. A quantitative analysis of three levels of the independent variable experimental design was employed. ANOVA tests were done to the three dependent variables. The findings showed statistically significant results of the embodiment principle in reducing the cognitive load, namely, in the mean score of HEA compared to LEA groups. However, no significant results were found between HEA and VOA groups. Looking at the three components of the cognitive load, the extraneous cognitive load was the only significant component among the three: intrinsic cognitive load, extraneous cognitive, and germane cognitive load. There was a statistically significant lower extraneous cognitive load score of HEA than the LEA. The findings did not show a significant difference among the groups’ level of motivation or grammar performance. The study started from the hypothesis that learning an English language grammatical concept through a customized video, which includes a HEA, could improve learners’ motivation, cognitive load, and performance. The results of this study provide new information on the extent to which such a video likely does and does not improve students’ learning experiences.",2021,,,,,159,2512416588,,,#56994,Alyahya 2021,,

Contexts in which relationships are particularly important are described, together with specific benefits (like trust) and task outcomes (like improved learning) known to be associated with relationship quality. We especially consider the problem of designing for long-term interaction, and define relational agents as computational artifacts designed to establish and maintain long-term social-emotional relationships with their users. We construct the first such agent, and evaluate it in a controlled experiment with 101 users who were asked to interact daily with an exercise adoption system for a month. Compared to an equivalent task-oriented agent without any deliberate social-emotional or relationship-building skills, the relational agent was respected more, liked more, and trusted more, even after four weeks of interaction. Additionally, users expressed a significantly greater desire to continue working with the relational agent after the termination of the study.

An anthropomorphic user interface is not immune to these judgments, specifically when exhibiting social interaction skills in public spaces. A favorable impression may help engaging users in interaction and attaining acceptance for long-term interactions. We present three studies implementing a model of first impressions for initiating user interactions with an anthropomorphic museum guide agent with socio-relational skills. We focus on nonverbal behavior exhibiting personality and interpersonal attitude. In two laboratory studies, we demonstrate that impressions of an agent's personality are quickly formed based on proximity, whereas interpersonal attitude is conveyed through smile and gaze. We also found that interpersonal attitude has greater impact than personality on the user's decision to spend time with the agent. These findings are then applied to a museum guide agent exhibited at the Boston Museum of Science. In this field study, we show that employing our model increases the number of visitors engaging in interaction. © 2016 ACM.",2016,,ACM Trans. Comput.-Hum.

Recent developments in affective computing have provided more opportunities in the way online IL education can be delivered. However, research on how affective computing can be used in IL education is lacking. The research objectives of this study are therefore twofold: to investigate the influence of affective embodied agents (EAs) on students' motivation, enjoyment, knowledge retention and intention to use; and to uncover factors influencing their intention to use an online IL tutorial with affective EAs. To achieve these objectives, 285 university students were recruited to participate in a betweensubjects experiment (text-only, non-affective EAs, and affective EAs), including completing an IL tutorial and a post-test questionnaire. The results suggested that students benefited from the added use of an affective EA in the IL tutorials, in terms of learning motivation and enjoyment.

65,First Impressions Count! The Role of the Human's Emotional State on Rapport Established with an Empathic versus Neutral Virtual Therapist,H. Ranjbartabar; D. Richards; A. Bilgin; C. Kutay,"Intelligent virtual agents are being endowed with empathic behaviours to perform roles such as virtual therapists. Studies often evaluate the level of rapport established, but do not measure the therapeutic benefit and the relative advantage of empathic versus neutral behaviours. We have created two virtual (empathic/neutral) therapists. Our experiment with 63 participants consisted of one within-subjects (empathic/neutral) and one between-subjects (order) factors. Regardless of the virtual therapist used, improvements in baseline emotion were reported after the first interaction (time one) and further improvement after the second interaction (time two). Our study reveals that if the human initially expresses strong emotional feeling for a problem they are facing, rapport will be higher for the empathic therapist and the level of rapport established at the first meeting will persist regardless of whether the second encounter used empathic or neutral dialogue. Conversely, participants experiencing low emotional feeling reported greater rapport with the neutral therapist, and that level of rapport persisted in the second encounter with the alternative therapist. This study shows that an empathic agent will not necessarily build more rapport or deliver better emotional outcomes than a neutral agent. Further studies are needed to determine when tailoring and complex behaviours are justified.",2019,,IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing,,,1-Jan,,10.1109/TAFFC.2019.2899305,,#54641,H 2019,,
66,"Developing a virtual coach for chronic patients: A user study on the impact of similarity, familiarity and realism","van Wissen, Arlette; Vinkers, Charlotte; van Halteren, Aart","Healthcare costs are increasing dramatically due to disproportional consumption of healthcare resources by chronic patients. Automated forms of health coaching can contribute to improved patient self-management while reducing costs due to increased scalability and availability of the use of human health coaches. Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs) seem to be good candidates to function as automated coaches, as they introduce a social component to human-computer interactions which makes them particularly suitable to influence a users attitude or behavior. To date, there is limited knowledge on the impact of appearance-related characteristics of an ECA as a virtual coach among a chronically ill elderly population. The primary aim of this study is to investigate the impact of three appearance cues on user acceptance: (i) similarity; (ii) familiarity; and (iii) realism. Findings demonstrate that patients (a) preferred the realistic-looking ECA over the more stylized one; (b) showed no preference for the familiar over the unfamiliar ECAs (but did evaluate the unfamiliar ECAs as more positive than the familiar one); and (c) evaluated an ECA as virtual coach for self-management support as useful.

The ability to guide the gaze orientation of others forms the backbone of joint attention. Recent research has raised the possibility that gaze following behaviors could induce liking. The present study seeks to investigate this hypothesis. We designed two physically different human avatars that could follow the gaze of users via eye-tracking technology. In a preliminary experiment, 20 participants assessed the baseline appeal of the two avatars and confirmed that the avatars differed in this respect. In the main experiment, we compared how 19 participants rated the two avatars in terms of pleasantness, trustworthiness and closeness when the avatars were following their gaze versus when the avatar generated gaze movements autonomously. Although the same avatar as in the preliminary experiment was rated more favorably, the pleasantness attributed to the two avatars increased when they followed the gaze of the participants. This outcome provides evidence that gaze following fosters liking independently of the baseline appeal of the individual.",2017,,Acta Psychologica,173,,66-72,,10.1016/j.actpsy.2016.12.006,,#4392,Grynszpan 2017,,

The computer animated agent, named ""Tinker"", uses nonverbal conversational behavior, empathy, social dialogue, reciprocal self-disclosure and other relational behavior to establish social bonds with users, and encourage continued interaction and repeated visits. Tinker describes exhibits in the museum, gives directions, and discusses technical aspects of her own implementation. Tinker also recognizes returning visitors through biometric analysis of their hand shapes and dialogue cues. Results from two experiments using Tinker are described. In the first, 29 returning visitors are randomized to interact with the agent with the biometric identification turned on or off. In the second experiment, 1,607 visitors are randomized to interact with versions of Tinker that have relationship-building behavior turned on or off. Results indicate that the use of relational behavior leads to significantly greater engagement by museum visitors, measured by session length, number of sessions, and self-reported attitude, as well as learning gains, as measured by a knowledge test, compared to the same agent that does not use relational behavior.

71,Impression detection and management using an embodied conversational agent,"Chen Wang; Biancardi, B.; Mancini, M.; Cafaro, A.; Pelachaud, C.; Pun, T.; Chanel, G.","Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs) are a promising medium for human-computer interaction, since they are capable of engaging users in real-time face-to-face interaction [1, 2]. Users' formed impressions of an ECA (e.g. favour or dislike) could be reflected behaviourally [3, 4]. These impressions may affect the interaction and could even remain afterwards [5, 7]. Thus, when we build an ECA to impress users, it is important to detect how users feel about the ECA. The impression the ECA leaves can then be adjusted by controlling its non-verbal behaviour [7]. Motivated by the role of ECAs in interpersonal interaction and the state-of-the-art on affect recognition, we investigated three research questions: 1) which modality (facial expressions, eye movements, and physiological signals) reveals most of the formed impressions; 2) whether an ECA could leave a better impression by maximizing the impression it produces; 3) whether there are differences in impression formation during human-human vs. human-agent interaction. Our results firstly showed the interest to use different modalities to detect impressions. An ANOVA test indicated that facial expressions performance outperforms the physiological modality performance (M = 1.27, p = 0.02). Secondly, our results presented the possibility of creating an adaptive ECA. Compared with the randomly selected ECA behaviour, participants' ratings tended to be higher in the conditions where the ECA adapted its behaviour based on the detected impressions.

72,The power of a nod and a glance: envelope vs. emotional feedback in animated conversational agents,"Cassell, J.; Thorisson, K.R.","We describe results from an experiment of user interaction with autonomous, human-like (humanoid) conversational agents. We hypothesize that for embodied conversational agents, nonverbal behaviours related to the process of conversation, what we call envelope feedback, is much more important than other feedback, such as emotional expression. We test this hypothesis by having subjects interact with three autonomous agents, all capable of full-duplex multimodal interaction: able to generate and recognize speech, intonation, facial displays, and gesture. Each agent, however, gave a different kind of feedback: (1) content-related only, (2) content+envelope feedback, and (3) content+emotional. Content-related feedback includes answering questions and executing commands; envelope feedback includes behaviours such as gaze, manual beat gesture, and head movements; emotional feedback includes smiles and looks of puzzlement. Subjects' evaluations of the system were collected with a questionnaire, and videotapes of their speech patterns and behaviours were scored according to how often the users repeated themselves, how often they hesitated, and how often they got frustrated. The results confirm our hypothesis that envelope feedback is more important in interaction than emotional feedback and that envelope feedback plays a crucial role in supporting the process of dialog. A secondary result from this study shows that users give our multimodal conversational humanoids very high ratings of lifelikeness and fluidity of interaction when the agents are capable of giving such feedback.",1999,,Applied Artificial Intelligence,13,,519-38,,10.1080/088395199117360,,#785,Cassell 1999,,

In the field of human-computer interaction, however, no works have been reported on the user study made with such volumetric capture avatars. This paper investigates how the volumetric capture avatar affects users' sense of social presence in immersive virtual environments. In our experiments, the volumetric capture avatar of an actor is compared with the actor captured in 2D video and another 3D avatar obtained by pre-scanning the actor. The experiment results show that users have the highest sense of social presence with the volumetric capture avatar when performing dynamic tasks whereas they have higher sense of social presence with the volumetric capture avatar and 2D video than with the pre-scanned avatar when performing static tasks. These imply that the emerging volumetric capture techniques can be an attractive tool for mixed reality, telepresence, and many other 3D applications. © 2020 IEEE.",2020,,"27th IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces, VR 2020",,,26-34,,10.1109/VR46266.2020.1581170537418,,#35466,Cho 2020,,
75,Modeling culture in intelligent virtual agents,"Mascarenhas, Samuel; Degens, Nick; Paiva, Ana; Prada, Rui; Hofstede, Gert; Beulens, Adrie; Aylett, Ruth","This work addresses the challenge of creating virtual agents that are able to portray culturally appropriate behavior when interacting with other agents or humans. Because culture influences how people perceive their social reality it is important to have agent models that explicitly consider social elements, such as existing relational factors. We addressed this necessity by integrating culture into a novel model for simulating human social behavior. With this model, we operationalized a particular dimension of culture-individualism versus collectivism-within the context of an interactive narrative scenario that is part of an agent-based tool for intercultural training. Using this scenario we conducted a cross-cultural study in which participants from a collectivistic country (Portugal) were compared with participants from an individualistic country (the Netherlands) in the way they perceived and interacted with agents whose behavior was either individualistic or collectivistic, according to the configuration of the proposed model. In the obtained results, Portuguese subjects rated the collectivistic agents more positively than the Dutch but both countries had a similarly positive opinion about the individualistic agents. This experiment sheds new light on how people from different countries differ when assessing the social appropriateness of virtual agents, while also raising new research questions on this matter.",2016,,Autonomous Agents & Multi-Agent Systems,30,5,931-962,,10.1007/s10458-015-9312-6,,#36300,Mascarenhas 2016,,
76,Attention and social cognition in virtual reality: The effect of engagement mode and character eye-gaze,"Rooney, B.; Balint, K.; Parsons, T.D.; Burke, C.; O’Leary, T.; Lee, S.C.T.; Mantei, C.","Technical developments in virtual humans are manifest in modern character design. Specifically, eye gaze offers a significant aspect of such design. There is need to consider the contribution of participant control of engagement. In the current study, we manipulated participants’ engagement with an interactive virtual reality narrative called Coffee without Words. Participants sat over coffee opposite a character in a virtual café, where they waited for their bus to be repaired. We manipulated character eye-contact with the participant. For half the participants in each condition, the character made no eye-contact for the duration of the story. For the other half, the character responded to participant eye-gaze by making and holding eye contact in return. To explore how participant engagement interacted with this manipulation, half the participants in each condition were instructed to appraise their experience as an artefact (i.e., drawing attention to technical features), while the other half were introduced to the fictional character, the narrative, and the setting as though they were real. This study allowed us to explore the contributions of character features (interactivity through eye-gaze) and cognition (attention/engagement) to the participants’ perception of realism, feelings of presence, time duration, and the extent to which they engaged with the character and represented their mental states (Theory of Mind).

77,The effect of realistic appearance of virtual characters in immersive environments - Does the character's personality play a role?,"Zibrek, K.; Kokkinara, E.; McDonnell, R.","Virtual characters that appear almost photo-realistic have been shown to induce negative responses from viewers in traditional media, such as film and video games. This effect, described as the uncanny valley, is the reason why realism is often avoided when the aim is to create an appealing virtual character. In Virtual Reality, there have been few attempts to investigate this phenomenon and the implications of rendering virtual characters with high levels of realism on user enjoyment. In this paper, we conducted a large-scale experiment on over one thousand members of the public in order to gather information on how virtual characters are perceived in interactive virtual reality games. We were particularly interested in whether different render styles (realistic, cartoon, etc.) would directly influence appeal, or if a character's personality was the most important indicator of appeal. We used a number of perceptual metrics such as subjective ratings, proximity, and attribution bias in order to test our hypothesis. Our main result shows that affinity towards virtual characters is a complex interaction between the character's appearance and personality, and that realism is in fact a positive choice for virtual characters in virtual reality. © 1995-2012 IEEE.",2018,,IEEE Trans Visual Comput Graphics,24,4,1681-1690,,10.1109/TVCG.2018.2794638,,#33104,Zibrek 2018,"Andrew Leeds (2022-02-15 12:13:46)(Select): Borderline; while significant variations to VH rendering and personality, ""interaction"" limited to primarily observation.; ",

Study on virtual Midas touch, masculinity, social status, and compliance in Polish men","Świdrak, J.; Pochwatko, G.; Insabato, A.","Traditional gender roles that define what is feminine and masculine also imply that men have higher social status than women. These stereotypes still influence how people interact with each other and with computers. Touch behaviour, essential in social interactions, is an interesting example of such social behaviours. The Midas touch effect describes a situation when a brief touch is used to influence one’s behaviour. Our study aimed to analyse the influence of virtual touch on compliance in men in a decision-making game called Ultimatum. In a series of three studies, we investigated whether social cues such as gender, stereotypical masculine/feminine appearance, and high/low social status modify compliance to offers from embodied agents. We built an immersive version of a repeated Ultimatum game in which a proposer offers how to split ten coins, and a responder accepts or rejects the offer. In study 1, men and women played with a female and a male agent. In study 2 and 3, men played with four agents each, differing in gender and levels of stereotypically seen masculinity and social status. There was no significant touch effect. Compliance was secured mostly by the value of the offer: the more generous the offer, the higher the compliance rate. We also found evidence for the perceived masculinity and social status influence. We also describe relationships between agents’ characteristics and the perception of their touch.

80,The influence of prosody on the requirements for gesture-text alignment,"Wang, Y.; Neff, M.","Designing an agent capable of multimodal communication requires synchronization of the agent's performance across its communication channels: text, prosody, gesture, body movement and facial expressions. The synchronization of gesture and spoken text has significant repercussions for agent design. To explore this issue, we examined people's sensitivity to misalignments between gesture and spoken text, varying both the gesture type and the prosodic emphasis. This study included ratings of individual clips and ratings of paired clips with different alignments. Subjects were unable to notice alignment errors of up to ±0.6s when shown a single clip. However, when shown paired clips, gestures occurring after the lexical affiliate are rated less positively. There is also evidence that stronger prosody cues make people more sensitive to misalignment. This suggests that agent designers may be able to ""cheat"" when it comes to maintaining tight synchronization between audio and gesture without a decrease in agent naturalness, but this cheating may not be optimal. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.",2013,,"13th International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents, IVA 2013",8108 LNAI,,180,,,,#19067,Wang 2013,Andrew Leeds (2022-03-04 11:22:01)(Select): Limited interaction; subjects rated sets of 10-second video clips of a character verbalizing and gesturing.; ,

Face movements, gaze direction, posture, vocal behavior, electrocardiogram and electrodermal activity were simultaneously recorded during the experimental sessions. Results showed that if participants were aware of interacting with an agent able to recognize their emotions, they reported that the computer was able to ""understand"" them and showed a higher number of nonverbal behaviors during the most interactive activity.

In 3 experiments, college students learned about synaptic transmission from a multimedia narrated presentation while their eye movements were tracked and subsequently took learning outcome tests. In Experiments 1 and 2, students who had a gesturing PA added to the screen performed significantly better on learning outcome tests of transfer (ds = 0.77 and 0.80) and retention (ds = 1.16 and 1.00) and spent more time attending to target material based on eye-tracking measures including fixation time (ds = 1.53 and 2.27) and number of fixations (ds = 1.54 and 1.70). In Experiments 2 and 3, students who learned with a gesturing PA outperformed those who learned with a static PA on transfer (ds = 0.72 and 1.02), retention (ds = 0.96 and 0.93), fixation time (ds = 2.07 and 1.82), and number of fixations (ds = 1.64 and 2.99).

91,Evaluating affective feedback of the 3D agent Max in a competitive cards game,"Becker, Christian; Prendinger, Helmut; Ishizuka, Mitsuru; Wachsmuth, Ipke","Within the field of Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs), the simulation of emotions has been suggested as a means to enhance the believability of ECAs and also to effectively contribute to the goal of more intuitive human-computer interfaces. Although various emotion models have been proposed, results demonstrating the appropriateness of displaying particular emotions within ECA applications are scarce or even inconsistent. Worse, questionnaire methods often seem insufficient to evaluate the impact of emotions expressed by ECAs on users. Therefore we propose to analyze non-conscious physiological feedback (bio-signals) of users within a clearly arranged dynamic interaction scenario where various emotional reactions are likely to be evoked. In addition to its diagnostic purpose, physiological user Information is also analyzed online to trigger empathic reactions of the ECA during game play, thus increasing the level of social engagement. To evaluate the appropriateness of different types of affective and empathic feedback, we implemented a cards game called Skip-Bo, where the user plays against an expressive 3D humanoid agent called Max, which was designed at the University of Bielefeld [6] and is based on the emotion simulation system of [2]. Work performed at the University of Tokyo and NII provided a real-time system for empathic (agent) feedback that allows one to derive user emotions from skin conductance and electromyography [13]. The findings of our study indicate that within a competitive gaming scenario, the absence of negative agent emotions is conceived as stressinducing and irritating, and that the integration of empathie feedback supports the acceptance of Max as a co-equal humanoid opponent.

92,Age-Related Differences in the Evaluation of a Virtual Health Agent's Appearance and Embodiment in a Health-Related Interaction: Experimental Lab Study,"Straßmann, C.; Krämer, N.C.; Buschmeier, H.; Kopp, S.","Background: Assistive technologies have become more important owing to the aging population, especially when they foster healthy behaviors. Because of their natural interface, virtual agents are promising assistants for people in need of support. To engage people during an interaction with these technologies, such assistants need to match the userś needs and preferences, especially with regard to social outcomes. Objective: Prior research has already determined the importance of an agent's appearance in a human-agent interaction. As seniors can particularly benefit from the use of virtual agents to maintain their autonomy, it is important to investigate their special needs. However, there are almost no studies focusing on age-related differences with regard to appearance effects. Methods: A 2×4 between-subjects design was used to investigate the age-related differences of appearance effects in a human-agent interaction. In this study, 46 seniors and 84 students interacted in a health scenario with a virtual agent, whose appearance varied (cartoon-stylized humanoid agent, cartoon-stylized machine-like agent, more realistic humanoid agent, and nonembodied agent [voice only]). After the interaction, participants reported on the evaluation of the agent, usage intention, perceived presence of the agent, bonding toward the agent, and overall evaluation of the interaction. Results: The findings suggested that seniors evaluated the agent more positively (liked the agent more and evaluated it as more realistic, attractive, and sociable) and showed more bonding toward the agent regardless of the appearance than did students. In addition, interaction effects were found. Seniors reported the highest usage intention for the cartoon-stylized humanoid agent, whereas students reported the lowest usage intention for this agent. The same pattern was found for participant bonding with the agent. Seniors showed more bonding when interacting with the cartoon-stylized humanoid agent or voice only agent, whereas students showed the least bonding when interacting with the cartoon-stylized humanoid agent. Conclusions: In health-related interactions, target group-related differences exist with regard to a virtual assistant's appearance. When elderly individuals are the target group, a humanoid virtual assistant might trigger specific social responses and be evaluated more positively at least in short-term interactions. © 2020 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

We also explored the relationship between physicality and social presence by conducting two user studies (n = 18 and n = 29). Both user studies took place in a medical team training context and involved virtual human ECAs as fellow team members.

There are two approaches to producing the virtual human speech: synthesized speech or recorded speech.

Two groups of medical students participated in a user study interviewing a virtual patient under each condition. We found no significant differences in the overall impression, speech intelligibility, and task performance. Our conclusion is that if the goal is to train students of which questions to ask, synthesized speech is just as effective as recorded speech. However, if the goal is to teach the student how to ask the correct questions, a high level of expressiveness in the virtual patient is needed. This in turn necessitates the higher cost - even with the lower flexibility - of recorded speech. © 2006 The authors.

95,Interactive hesitation synthesis: Modelling and evaluation,"Betz, S.; Carlmeyer, B.; Wagner, P.; Wrede, B.","Conversational spoken dialogue systems that interact with the user rather than merely reading the text can be equipped with hesitations to manage dialogue flow and user attention. Based on a series of empirical studies, we elaborated a hesitation synthesis strategy for dialogue systems, which inserts hesitations of a scalable extent wherever needed in the ongoing utterance. Previously, evaluations of hesitation systems have shown that synthesis quality is affected negatively by hesitations, but that they result in improvements of interaction quality. We argue that due to its conversational nature, hesitation synthesis needs interactive evaluation rather than traditional mean opinion score (MOS)-based questionnaires. To validate this claim, we dually evaluate our system’s speech synthesis component, on the one hand, linked to the dialogue system evaluation, and on the other hand, in a traditional MOS way. We are thus able to analyze and discuss differences that arise due to the evaluation methodology. Our results suggest that MOS scales are not sufficient to assess speech synthesis quality, leading to implications for future research that are discussed in this paper. Furthermore, our results indicate that synthetic hesitations are able to increase task performance and that an elaborated hesitation strategy is necessary to avoid likability issues. © 2018 by the authors.

96,Combining trunk movement and facial expression enhances the perceived intensity and believability of an avatar's pain expression,"Treal, T.; Jackson, P.L.; Meugnot, A.","The use of computer-generated characters (avatars) is increasingly being used to study emotion and social cognition in humans, as it offers a highly controllable, yet potentially interactive experimental set-up. However, avatars often fall short at conveying credible emotions. This study explored the interaction between body motion and facial expression on the perceived intensity and believability of an avatar's pain expression. Adults were shown videos of an agematched avatar displaying facial expressions of pain while the body was static or while the trunk was oscillating at varied amplitudes, which represented human dynamic equilibrium (idle motion) or trunk rocking expressing a sustained pain (pain behavior). Pupil size was recorded during the task as an objective marker of emotional reaction. Results showed that the avatar's pain was perceived to be more intense and more believable in the presence of both idle motion and trunk rocking than in the static condition. Pupil dilated more when facial pain expression was combined with trunk rocking than in the static and idle conditions. This work demonstrated the critical role of idle motion when creating dynamical pain-expressing avatars, as well as the potentiating effect of body motion when combined with facial expression on the perception of avatar's pain. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2020,,Comput.

97,Conversational gaze aversion for virtual agents,"Andrist, S.; Mutlu, B.; Gleicher, M.","In conversation, people avert their gaze from one another to achieve a number of conversational functions, including turn-taking, regulating intimacy, and indicating that cognitive effort is being put into planning an utterance. In this work, we enable virtual agents to effectively use gaze aversions to achieve these same functions in conversations with people. We extend existing social science knowledge of gaze aversion by analyzing video data of human dyadic conversations. This analysis yielded precise timings of speaker and listener gaze aversions, enabling us to design gaze aversion behaviors for virtual agents. We evaluated these behaviors for their ability to achieve positive conversational functions in a laboratory experiment with 24 participants. Results show that virtual agents employing gaze aversion are perceived as thinking, are able to elicit more disclosure from human interlocutors, and are able to regulate conversational turn-taking. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.",2013,,"13th International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents, IVA 2013",8108 LNAI,,249,,,,#19041,Andrist 2013,,

However, only recently have researchers began to question how trust influences perceptions of virtual humans and learning with a virtual human. In this study, we use unsupervised machine learning (k-means clustering) to examine the extent to which learners trust a virtual human with different voices. General trust attitudes toward a virtual human were measured using a validated questionnaire after participants watched videos of the virtual human presenting educational information. The results indicated that a virtual human with a low-quality text-to-speech (TTS) voice had the most variation in perceived trust, followed by a high-quality TTS voice and a recorded human voice. In addition, trust significantly influenced perceptions of the virtual human persona in the TTS conditions, whereas it had little influence on measures of persona in the recorded human voice condition. Finally, trust had little influence on learning outcomes in any of the conditions. While previous findings have shown that trust can vary between voice conditions, the results presented here show that different types of voices led to different trust responses even within voice conditions, raising important implications for instructional designers.",2021,,Computers & Education,160,,104039,,10.1016/j.compedu.2020.104039,,#4373,Schroeder 2021,,

The evaluation of our approach is based on a comparison of the socially adaptive agent to a simple scripted agent and to an emotionally-reactive one. Videos of these three different agents in situation have been created and evaluated by 83 participants. This subjective evaluation shows that the simulation and expression of social attitude is perceived by the users and impacts on the evaluation of the agent’s credibility.

Two studies provide initial evaluation of user behavior with a MRH patient and the usability and acceptability of a MRH patient for practice and evaluation of medical students' clinical skills. In Study I (n=8) it was observed that students treated MRHs as social actors more than students in prior interactions with virtual human patients (n=27), and used interpersonal touch to comfort and reassure the MRH patient similarly to prior interactions with human patients (n=76). In the within-subjects Study II (n=11), medical students performed a clinical breast exam on each of a MRH and human patient. Participants performed equivalent exams with the MRH and human patients, demonstrating the usability of MRHs to evaluate students' exam skills. The acceptability of the MRH patient for practicing exam skills was high as students rated the experience as believable and educationally beneficial.

The experiment used three conditions: one with no apparent non-verbal behavior by the ECA, one with non-verbal behavior governed by an extrovert-based emotional model, and one with an introvert-based emotional model, in the context of negative evaluation of a virtual employee's performance. The results indicate that the overall perceived social presence and game experience across all conditions were quite high. Moreover, people who were exposed to the extrovert-based condition experienced significantly higher levels of behavioral involvement as part of their social presence compared to the other two conditions. Furthermore, no significant differences between the game experience of participants across the different conditions were observed. These results suggest that the projection of non-verbal behavior as a result of incorporating personality as part of the emotional model of an ECA could have an influence on the elicited feeling of social presence from the users with respect to behavioral involvement; and more assertive and pronounced non-verbal behaviors seem to have higher impacts, than their submissive and minimal counterparts.  2018 IEEE.",2018,,,,,City-of Wurzburg; Julius-Maximilians University,,10.1109/VS-Games.2018.8493436,,#1597,Sajjadi 2018,,

When developing Internet-based VH health interventions, the developers have to make several design decisions on VH’s appearance, role, language, or medium. The design decisions can affect the outcomes of the Internet-based VH health intervention. To help make design decisions, the current paper presents design guidelines drawn from two studies. The two studies used Internet-based VH health intervention to promote colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. The two studies examined the influence of visual design and the influence of the information medium on user intentions to pursue more health information. In the first study, the qualitative analysis of the focus group (n = 73 users in 13 focus groups) transcripts shows that the VH’s visual realism, the VH’s healthcare role, and the presence of a local healthcare provider’s logo influenced the user perceptions of the intervention. The findings from the focus groups were used to iterate the intervention and derive design guidelines. In the second study (n = 1400), the analysis of online surveys from users after the VH-based intervention showed that to positively influence the user intentions to pursue the health topic further, the results recommend the use of an animated VH to deliver health information compared to other mediums of information delivery, such as text. The analysis also shows that very few user comments were related to the VH’s appearance after visual design iterations in the second study.

Memory assists in building rapport and gaining trust. The growing field of artificial companions involving long term and casual/social relationships will require appropriate handling of memories of the user by an Intelligent Virtual Agent (IVA). This is a first study to determine what types of personal information (i.e., domain/task and casual/social) users expected an IVA to discuss and remember and how users responded to various levels of IVA recall and forgetting of that information: complete recall; total loss of recall; partial recall and incorrect recall. Our experiment collected conversations and survey responses from participants who interacted with a virtual real estate agent according to one of two treatments over three experimental sessions. No significant differences were found in participants׳ responses between task-focused or casual/social content, however a larger sample size may produce different results and some participants were not comfortable with answering the social questions. Recall was found to increase the user׳s enjoyment of interacting with the agent and also to increase the believability of the character over multiple interactions. We found that characters who recall information incorrectly are highly frustrating, are seen as having unnatural memory and this decreases the believability of the character. However, characters that exhibit forgetting, either explicitly stating their forgetfulness or not mentioning it at all, are seen to have a more natural memory and can help to increase the believability of the character.

However, little is known about what makes these characters appear realistic. In this paper, we investigate human sensitivity to audio mismatches (i.e., when individuals' voices are not matched to their gestures) and visual desynchronization (i.e., when the body motions of the individuals in a group are mis-aligned in time) in virtual human conversers. Using motion capture data from a range of both polite conversations and arguments, we conduct a series of perceptual experiments and determine some factors that contribute to the plausibility of virtual conversing groups. We found that participants are more sensitive to visual desynchronization of body motions, than to mismatches between the characters' gestures and their voices. Furthermore, synthetic conversations can appear sufficiently realistic once there is an appropriate balance between talker and listener roles. This is regardless of body motion desynchronization or mismatched audio.",2010,,,,,,,10.1145/1833349.1778828,,#187,Ennis 2010,,

Experiment 2 showed that the social meaning of a pedagogical agent's smile might be perceived by learners as polite or fake. In addition, qualitative data provided insights into factors that may cause negative perceptions of a pedagogical agent's smile, which in turn lead to negative affective (emotional and motivational) states in learners.

Sometimes they act as (autonomous) embodied conversational agents, and sometimes they represent human visitors and reflect (real-time) actions performed by the human visitors or users of the environment. It is not always necessary to represent a full body or any body at all. However, there are also many applications where it can be useful to have an embodied agents that does not only allow verbal interaction, but also interacts through nonverbal means, including a display of emotion. In this paper we survey the main modalities to show emotion in an embodied conversational agent. We argue that for many situations it is more important to have subtle ways of adding nonverbal cues to agent-human interaction than to be able to express some discrete full-blown emotions. We illustrate this with two of our research projects, one on gaze behavior of an embodied conversational agent, and one on showing intensities and blends of emotions in facial expressions of an embodied agent.",2002,,,vol.2,,208-15,,,,#1547,Nijholt 2002,Andrew Leeds (2022-03-22 09:31:13)(Select): Borderline; Fidelity study results summarized in brief at Section 5.1; ,
124,Effect of an agent's contingent responses on maintaining an intentional stance,"Ohmoto, Y.; Ueno, S.; Nishida, T.","To establish social relationships between a human and an artificial agent, the agent has to induce and maintain the intentional stance on its human partner. In this study, we focus on contingency, which is the behavior that occurs synchronously with the last action, and the icebreaker, which is a facilitation exercise that helps start an interaction. The aim of this study is to investigate whether an agent that implements contingent responses is capable of inducing and maintaining an intentional stance. We conducted an experiment using the contingent agent and a ""subgoal-oriented agent"" as a control group. As a result, we conclude that the contingent responses are capable of maintaining the intentional stance during the main task from the behavior analysis. On the other hand, we suggested that only the participants who actively joined the icebreaker with the contingent agent be induced into taking an intentional stance.

To explore this idea, we developed two virtual agents that attempt to motivate users to perform healthy behaviors - either to increase exercise or fruit and vegetable consumption - and systematically vary whether they use humor or not in their counseling conversations. Human-authored jokes were selected from a large corpus based on the nature of the humor (empathetic affiliative humor that serves to build relational closeness), health topic relevance, and subjective ratings of funniness, as well as relevance to user stage of behavior change. We evaluated our agents in a two-treatment counterbalanced within-subjects experiment, where participants interacted with a humorous and non-humorous agent motivating either exercise or healthy diet. We found the interaction with the humorous agent led to a significantly greater change in motivation to engage in the target behavior than interacting with the non-humorous agent.",2020,,,,,,,10.1145/3383652.3423915,,#727,Olafsson 2020,,

Several knowledge gaps are identified: motivational interviewing and small talk must be translated to control rules for this coach, a formal model of participant emotional states is needed to allow the coach to parse the learner's emotional state, and various sensors must be used to let the coach detect and act on this state. We use the situated Cognitive Engineering (sCE) method to update an existing foundation of knowledge with emotional models, motivational interviewing, and small talk theory, technology, and a new exercise in the volunteer work domain. We use this foundation to create a design specification for an Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA) coach that provides cognitive, affective, and social learning support for this exercise. A prototype is created, and compared to a prototype that only provides cognitive support in a within- and between-subjects experiment. Results show that both prototypes work as expected: learners interact with the coach and complete all exercises. Almost no significant differences are found between the two prototypes, indicating that the affective and social support were not effective as designed. Potential improvements are provided for future work.

The current study analyzes the interface design of such Live Help functions. More specifically, it attempts to understand whether or not the implementation of Text-To-Speech (TTS) voice communication and 3D avatars in the user interface of Live Help affects consumers' views of their own interactions with a service person.A laboratory experiment was designed to empirically test the hypotheses that TTS voice communication and 3D avatars can significantly affect consumers' perceptions of presence and flow. A 2*3 full factorial design was used (assessing three options for the use of voice and text, and two options for the use of avatars). The results of the experiment demonstrate that the presence of TTS voice significantly increases consumers' perceptions of flow (a construct depicting a user's interaction with a computer as playful and exploratory), while 3D avatars enhance consumers' feelings of telepresence (a user's experience of seeming to be present in a remote environment by means of a communication medium).

They serve as communicative partners in a variety of applications, such as tutoring systems, sales, or entertainment. This paper first discusses design principles for animated agents to enhance their effectiveness as tutors, sales persons, or actors, among other roles. It is argued that agents should support their perception as social actors by displaying human-like social cues such as affect and gestures. An architecture for emotion-based agents will be described and a simplified version of the model will be illustrated by two interaction scenarios that feature cartoon-style characters and can be run in a web browser. The second focus of this paper is an empirical evaluation of the effect of an affective agent on users' emotional state which is derived from physiological signals of the user.

129,A virtual tourist counselor expressing intimacy behaviors: A new perspective to create emotion in visitors and offer them a better user experience?,"Potdevin, Delphine; Clavel, Celine; Sabouret, Nicolas","Professional embodied conversational agents (ECAs) deployed in the market are dedicated to satisfying the digital customer relationship. However, ECAs still suffer from a lack of user adoption, in particular because most of them have few social skills. Inspired by social presence theories and based on the ergonomic components of user experience (CUE) model (Mahlke and Lindgaard, 2007), the paper focuses on one social skill, i.e., virtual intimacy, a 3-dimensional concept including honesty and genuineness, positivity and mutual comprehension. Virtual intimacy may be a way to reinforce the social dimension of human-agent interactions and to provide a better user experience. We therefore propose an interactive experiment that incorporates natural interactions between real tourists and an autonomously intimate virtual counselor who is an expert in tourism and able to express intimacy-related behaviors in verbal and nonverbal communication. The paper studies the impact of the agent's expression of intimacy-related behaviors on the perception of virtual intimacy, social presence and the user experience. The results show that users adopt a social attitude toward the intimate counselor, and although they do not significantly perceive virtual intimacy, they clearly perceive the dimension of honesty and genuineness. Moreover, the agent's expression of intimacy only enhances copresence, the first perceptive level of social presence. Except for user social status, which is enhanced, the user experience is also not significantly influenced by intimate expression. The study results further demonstrate that perceiving virtual intimacy is a good predictor of social presence and user experience, especially user emotional reactions. Perceiving virtual intimacy influences user experience independently of social presence, which thereby indicates that independent intimacy-related mechanisms, such as emotional contagion, may be involved. Mediation analyses also underline that perceiving virtual intimacy has a direct effect on user emotional reactions, but this finding is not supported by the CUE model. The findings in this study provide new evidence that perceiving virtual intimacy in human-agent interaction elicits emotions in users and enhances user experience. In line with this, we propose an outline for an ECA-adapted, user experience model based on the CUE model.  2021 Elsevier Ltd",2021,,International Journal of Human Computer Studies,150,,,,10.1016/j.ijhcs.2021.102612,,#1801,Potdevin 2021,,

Instead, after an initial rise in acceptability there will be a pronounced decrease when the character is similar, but not identical to human form (Mori, 1970/2012). Moreover, it has been claimed but never directly tested that movement would accentuate this dip and make moving characters less acceptable. We used a number of full-body animated computer characters along with a parametrically defined motion set to examine the effect of motion quality on the uncanny valley. We found that improving the motion quality systematically improved the acceptability of the characters. In particular, the character classified in the deepest location of the uncanny valley became more acceptable when it was animated. Our results showed that although an uncanny valley was found for static characters, the deepening of the valley with motion, originally predicted by Mori (1970/2012), was not obtained. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",2014,,Cognition,130,3,271-277,,10.1016/j.cognition.2013.11.001,,#30474,Piwek 2014,,

Although the most persuasive computer interfaces are often the most human-like, they have been predicted to incur the greatest risk of falling into the uncanny valley, the loss of empathy attributed to characters that appear eerily human. Previous studies compared interfaces on the left side of the uncanny valley, namely, those with low human likeness. To examine interfaces with higher human realism, a between-groups factorial experiment was conducted through the internet with 426 midwestern U.S. undergraduates. This experiment presented a hypothetical ethical dilemma followed by the advice of an authority figure. The authority was manipulated in three ways: depiction (digitally recorded or computer animated), motion quality (smooth or jerky), and advice (disclose or refrain from disclosing sensitive information). Of these, only the advice changed opinion about the ethical dilemma, even though the animated depiction was significantly eerier than the human depiction. These results indicate that compliance with an authority persists even when using an uncannily realistic computeranimated double. © 2015 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",2015,,Presence Teleoper.

Furthermore, the dynamics between the different metrics of game experience and social presence of people are explored to determine which game experience metrics are the strongest predictors of perceived social presence in this context. A personality-based emotional model is used for personifying the employed ECA, which governs the manifestation of its non-verbal behaviors. Three experimental conditions manipulating the existence and intensity of non-verbal behaviors exhibited by the ECA were used to investigate the effect of this proposed approach. The results of the experiment with 41 participants indicate that people who were exposed to an extrovert ECA experienced significantly higher levels of behavioral involvement as part of their social presence compared to the other conditions. These results suggest that incorporating personality by means of non-verbal behavior in the emotional model of an ECA influences users perceived feeling of social presence. Furthermore, our results reveal that there is a bidirectional relationship between game experience metrics and perceived social presence of people as each predict the other.

EEG-based evaluation of animated virtual characters,"Mustafa, M.; Guthe, S.; Tauscher, J.-P.; Goesele, M.; Magnor, M.","There is a continuous effort by animation experts to create increasingly realistic and more human-like digital characters. However, as virtual characters become more human they risk evoking a sense of unease in their audience. This sensation, called the Uncanny Valley effect, is widely acknowledged both in the popular media and scientific research but empirical evidence for the hypothesis has remained inconsistent. In this paper, we investigate the neural responses to computer-generated faces in a cognitive neuroscience study. We record brain activity from participants (N = 40) using electroencephalography (EEG) while they watch videos of real humans and computer-generated virtual characters. Our results show distinct differences in neural responses for highly realistic computer-generated faces such as Digital Emily compared with real humans. These differences are unique only to agents that are highly photorealistic, i.e. the 'uncanny' response. Based on these specific neural correlates we train a support vector machine (SVM) to measure the probability of an uncanny response for any given computer-generated character from EEG data.

To help address this question, students were asked to twice view a 4-min narrated presentation on how solar cells work in which the screen showed an animated pedagogical agent standing to the left of 11 successive slides. Across three experiments, learners performed better on a transfer test when a human-voiced agent displayed human-like gestures, facial expression, eye gaze, and body movement than when the agent did not, yielding an embodiment effect. In Experiment 2 the embodiment effect was found when the agent spoke in a human voice but not in a machine voice. In Experiment 3, the embodiment effect was found both when students were told the onscreen agent was consistent with their choice of agent characteristics and when inconsistent. Students who viewed a highly embodied agent also rated the social attributes of the agent more positively than did students who viewed a nongesturing agent. The results are explained by social agency theory, in which social cues in a multimedia message prime a feeling of social partnership in the learner, which leads to deeper cognitive processing during learning, and results in a more meaningful learning outcome as reflected in transfer test performance. © 2012 American Psychological Association.",2012,,J.

144,Effects of Humanness of Virtual Agents on Impression Formation,"Krumhuber, Eva; Kappas, Arvid; Hall, Mark; Hodgson, John","In recent years, the use of virtual agents that act as an interface between human and computer has become increasingly popular. Such agents typically appear as embodied characters and display various types of life-like behaviour. To ensure the acceptance with the user, questions relating to the humanness of their appearance play an important role. How realistic and human-like should a character look like? Agents which lack human realism may be less anthropomorphized and evoke fewer social responses. On the other hand, if they resemble humans too closely they may be perceived as unpleasant and produce feelings of uncanniness [Mori 1970].",2012,,,,,,,10.1145/2491599.2491606,,#50971,Krumhuber 2012,"Andrew Leeds (2022-03-19 08:30:09)(Select): Borderline; limited VH interaction with participants only evaluating a set of static images at 5 s each, or a set of video clips at 10 s each.

145,Social Conformity in Immersive Virtual Environments: The Impact of Agents’ Gaze Behavior,"Kyrlitsias, C.; Michael-Grigoriou, D.; Banakou, D.; Christofi, M.","Immersive virtual reality (IVR) can induce an experience of “social presence” which can, in turn, increase social influence. Non-verbal behavior such as eye contact is an important component of human communication and, therefore, an important factor in creating social presence. This paper presents an experimental study that elaborates social influence through conformity with a group of virtual agents within an immersive virtual environment (IVE). Specifically, it investigates the impact of the agents’ gaze behavior on social presence and influence. An experiment based on the Asch (1951) paradigm using two levels of agents’ gaze behavior (Eye Contact condition vs. No-Eye Contact condition) was conducted. The results showed that participants conformed with the agents as they gave significantly more incorrect responses to the trials that the agents also gave an incorrect response, compared to those trials that the agents gave correct answers. However, no impact of the agents’ gaze behavior on conformity was observed, even if the participants in the Eye Contact condition reported a higher sense of social presence. In addition, self-reported measures showed a number of social effects that occurred only in the eye contact condition, indicating that the agents’ gaze behavior has an impact on participants’ experience. © Copyright © 2020 Kyrlitsias, Michael-Grigoriou, Banakou and Christofi.",2020,,Front.

We developed a virtual job interview simulation at a university career service to help student populations faced with the prospect of their first job interview. The virtual job interview simulation can deliver a realistic mock job interview within a high-quality immersive system that is similar to professional virtual reality (VR) systems. We conducted two experimental studies with a common theme: the role of graphical reality of the virtual interviewer and the immersive visual display in the virtual job interview simulation. The results are presented in this study based on a psycho-physiological approach, revealing variation in the distribution of participants′ anxiety state across various VR conditions. The overall conclusion of this study is that the sense of anxiety is less correlated to the graphical realism in VR environment even though the more graphically detailed the virtual human was, the more it provoked a sense of presence. In addition, at least some degree of physical immersion is needed to maintain anxiety levels over the course of VR exposure.",2013,,International Journal of Human-Computer Studies,71,10,978-987,,10.1016/j.ijhcs.2013.07.003,,#4977,Kwon 2013,,

We present a data-driven solution that moves towards a more natural synthesis of hand and arm gestures by recreating gestural behaviour in the style of a human performer.

We empirically validated the use of gesture units in the generation and show that it causes the virtual human to be perceived as more natural.

The instructional impact of this interaction in learning environments has not been established, however. This study examined the impact of emotion and gender of a pedagogical agent as a learning companion (PAL) on social judgements, interest, self-efficacy, and learning. Two experiments investigated separately the effects of a PAL's emotional expression and empathetic response. Experiment 1 focused on emotional expression (positive vs. negative vs. neutral) and gender (male vs. female) with a sample of 142 male and female college students in a computer literacy course. Experiment 2 investigated the impact of empathetic response (responsive vs. non-responsive) and gender with 56 pre-service teachers. Overall, the results yielded main and interaction effects of PAL emotion and gender on the dependent variables. In particular, the PAL's empathetic response had a positive impact on learner interest and self-efficacy; PAL gender had a positive impact on recall. The findings imply that the emotion and the gender of the digital learning companion could be utilized to optimize college students' motivation and learning. © 2007 The Authors.

151,Does a Digital Assistant Need a Body? the Influence of Visual Embodiment and Social Behavior on the Perception of Intelligent Virtual Agents in AR,"Kim, K.; Boelling, L.; Haesler, S.; Bailenson, J.; Bruder, G.; Welch, G.F.","Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVAs) are becoming part of our everyday life, thanks to artificial intelligence technology and Internet of Things devices. For example, users can control their connected home appliances through natural voice commands to the IVA. However, most current-state commercial IVAs, such as Amazon Alexa, mainly focus on voice commands and voice feedback, and lack the ability to provide non-verbal cues which are an important part of social interaction. Augmented Reality (AR) has the potential to overcome this challenge by providing a visual embodiment of the IVA. In this paper we investigate how visual embodiment and social behaviors influence the perception of the IVA. We hypothesize that a user's confidence in an IVA's ability to perform tasks is improved when imbuing the agent with a human body and social behaviors compared to the agent solely depending on voice feedback. In other words, an agent's embodied gesture and locomotion behavior exhibiting awareness of the surrounding real world or exerting influence over the environment can improve the perceived social presence with and confidence in the agent. We present a human-subject study, in which we evaluated the hypothesis and compared different forms of IVAs with speech, gesturing, and locomotion behaviors in an interactive AR scenario. The results show support for the hypothesis with measures of confidence, trust, and social presence. We discuss implications for future developments in the field of IVAs. © 2018 IEEE.",2019,,"17th IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality, ISMAR 2018",,,105-114,,10.1109/ISMAR.2018.00039,,#22249,Kim 2019,,

For digital humans to be effective and engaging in these roles, it is important they can build close relationships with people. Emotional expressiveness can improve social closeness in human relationships, especially for females. However, it is unknown whether multimodal emotional expression improves relationships with digital humans. Participants were 185 adults aged 18 years or older with English fluency. Participants were block-randomized by gender to complete the Relationship Closeness Induction Task with one of six versions of a digital human. The digital humans varied in modality richness (face, no face) and emotional expression (emotional voice, neutral voice; emotional face, neutral face). Participants’ language was analysed for emotional content using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count software. A series of three-way ANOVA and ANCOVA were conducted to evaluate the effect of digital human face type, voice type, and participant gender on emotional content in participant language. A digital human with no face was associated with more first-person singular pronoun use than a neutral face and an emotional face digital human. A digital human with no face and a neutral voice received more general negative emotion language than a digital human with no face and an emotional voice. Findings suggest the presence of a face and emotion in the voice may improve emotional responses to digital humans.

155,When a talking-face computer agent is half-human and half-humanoid: Human identity and consistency preference,"Gong, L.; Nass, C.","Computer-generated anthropomorphic characters are a growing type of communicator that is deployed in digital communication environments. An essential theoretical question is how people identify humanlike but clearly artificial, hence humanoid, entities in comparison to natural human ones. This identity categorization inquiry was approached under the framework of consistency and tested through examining inconsistency effects from mismatching categories. Study 1 (N = 80), incorporating a self-disclosure task, tested participants' responses to a talking-face agent, which varied in four combinations of human versus humanoid faces and voices. In line with the literature on inconsistency, the pairing of a human face with a humanoid voice or a humanoid face with a human voice led to longer processing time in making judgment of the agent and less trust than the pairing of a face and a voice from either the human or the humanoid category. Female users particularly showed negative attitudes toward inconsistently paired talking faces. Study 2 (N = 80), using a task that stressed comprehension demand, replicated the inconsistency effects on judging time and females' negative attitudes but not for comprehension-related outcomes. Voice clarity overshadowed the consistency concern for comprehension-related responses. The overall inconsistency effects suggest that people treat humanoid entities in a different category from natural human ones. © 2007 International Communication Association.",2007,,Hum. Commun.

Specifically, immersive multimedia environments, such as virtual reality increase the likelihood that students undergo distractions in which information seeking during system-paced instruction occurred. Although previous studies have reviewed various cue designs to yield students’ higher attention, skepticism still exists regarding which ways cue designs can support their learning comprehension in video instruction. For this study, we sampled a total of 64 undergraduates in a university. Using video instruction performed by an animated pedagogical agent (APA), this study examined the effect of social (i.e., an APA’s conversational gestures) and cognitive (i.e., visual cue) cues on students’ learning comprehension and eye-gaze data within types of visual information (text and pictorial). Also, this study investigated how both cues promoted students’ cognitive load overall. Specific to text information processing, the results of the study confirmed that the negative prime effect of social cues undermined students’ learning comprehension and increased their cognitive load, whereas cognitive cues appeared to be supportive in video instruction. Also, this study found that students’ different visual-attention patterns appeared in pictorial information processing.

Switching from a full-body to a close-up view did not result in significant changes of the counselor’s visual attention. Further, the research indicates switching views may undermine the perception of a natural interaction. Counselors considered the experience useful. The research suggests study and design considerations to enhance future social skills training environments. © The Author(s) 2019.",2020,,J. Def. Model.

170,Evaluation of affective embodied agents in an information literacy game,"Guo, Yan Ru; Goh, Dion Hoe-Lian","Digital game-based learning (DGBL) has become increasingly popular. With elements such as narratives, rewards, rules, and interactivity, DGBL can actively engage learners, stimulating desired learning outcomes. In an effort to increase its appeal, affective embodied agents (EAs) have been incorporated into DGBL as learning companions or instructors. However, claims about the efficacy of using affective EAs in DGBL have scarcely been subjected to empirical analysis. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the influence of affective EAs on students' learning outcome, motivation, enjoyment, perceived usefulness, and behavioral intention in an information literacy (IL) game. In total, 159 tertiary students were recruited and randomly assigned in a pre-test post-test between-subjects experiment with three conditions: affective-EA, neutral-EA, and no-EA. Results suggested that students benefited from interacting with the affective EA in the IL game, in terms of learning motivation, enjoyment, perceived usefulness and behavioral intention. However, there was no significant difference in learning outcome.",2016,,Computers & Education,103,,59-75,,10.1016/j.compedu.2016.09.013,,#5073,Guo 2016,,

This paper presents an empirical study that compared three theories of agent realism: Realism Maximization Theory, Uncanny Valley Theory, and Consistency Theory.

However, recent research (Craig & Schroeder, 2017) found modern computer voice was as effective as human voice in certain social measures, and can outperformed human voice in particular learning outcomes. This research aimed to study whether two human voice conditions (prosodic and non-prosodic) produced consistent measures when compared against modern computer voice and each other in social perception and retention measures with non-native speakers. The human non-prosodic voice was rated significantly higher on four of seven scale items compared to modern computer voice. However, no significant differences were found in the retention of information. These results show that non-native speakers prefer human voice with less prosodic elements, and factors behind voice are more complicated than just categorizing it as either human or computer. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",2019,,Comput Educ,140,,,,10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103605,,#34698,Davis 2019,,

Although this might be beneficial for native English-speaking students who possess high levels of comprehension, only using pointing gestures with foreign language students learning English is problematic because these students need more assistance with language comprehension than just directing spatial awareness. The purpose of this study was to explore how gesture type and gesture frequency help foreign language students perceive the agent’s persona and the ability to recall procedural information. The results found one significant interaction between average gestures and no gesture in terms of facilitation, but all other conditions and persona subscales were not significant. For learning outcomes, the enhanced gesture condition significantly recalled more information than the no gesture condition (p = 0.017), and was approaching significance with the conversational gesture condition (p = 0.059). The findings suggest that when the learning population consists of foreign language students, pedagogical agents should use representational and beat gestures to help students comprehend more of the language, and the gesture frequency needs to be increased to account for the lack of verbal listening skills with this population. © 2019 British Educational Research Association",2019,,Br J Educ Technol,50,6,3252-3263,,10.1111/bjet.12732,,#34421,Davis 2019,,

The impact of each voice type on learning, cognitive load, and perceptions of the virtual human were examined. The study found that the modern voice engine produced significantly more learning on transfer outcomes, had greater training efficiency, and was rated at the same level as an agent with a human voice for facilitating learning and credibility while outperforming the older speech engine.

176,The Reverse Chameleon Effect: Negative Social Consequences of Anatomical Mimicry,"Casasanto, D.; Casasanto, L.S.; Gijssels, T.; Hagoort, P.","Bodily mimicry often makes the mimickee have more positive feelings about the mimicker. Yet, little is known about the causes of mimicry’s social effects. When people mimic each other’s bodily movements face to face, they can either adopt a mirrorwise perspective (moving in the same absolute direction) or an anatomical perspective (moving in the same direction relative to their own bodies). Mirrorwise mimicry maximizes visuo-spatial similarity between the mimicker and mimickee, whereas anatomical mimicry maximizes the similarity in the states of their motor systems. To compare the social consequences of visuo-spatial and motoric similarity, we asked participants to converse with an embodied virtual agent (VIRTUO), who mimicked their head movements either mirrorwise, anatomically, or not at all. Compared to participants who were not mimicked, those who were mimicked mirrorwise tended to rate VIRTUO more positively, but those who were mimicked anatomically rated him more negatively. During face-to-face conversation, mirrorwise and anatomical mimicry have opposite social consequences. Results suggest that visuo-spatial similarity between mimicker and mimickee, not similarity in motor system activity, gives rise to the positive social effects of bodily mimicry. © Copyright © 2020 Casasanto, Casasanto, Gijssels and Hagoort.",2020,,Front.

This study extends Expectancy Violations Theory (EVT) to examine how different forms of interfaces that confirm or violate user expectations affect the communication process, social judgments, ability to influence, and accuracy of recall associated with HtEAC. Positive violations of expectancy are acts or characteristics of the EA that are unexpected but evaluated favorably by the human partner. Results suggest that when the EA deviates from expectations, effects on the HtEAC process and related outcomes can be more pronounced. EAs evaluated as positive violations had more favorable effects on task attractiveness than other human or EA interaction partners. As predicted by EVT, EA interactions that were positively evaluated elicited more perceived connectedness, feelings of being understood/receptivity, and dependability than those EA interactions evaluated negatively. However, negative violations did not produce worse outcomes than negative confirmations. EVT offers a useful lens for examining the communication effects of HtEAC and points to benefits of creating EAs that evoke positive violations of expectancy. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

A case study in the context of a dice game,"Bosse, T.; Zwanenburg, E.","To endow game characters with more realistic affective behavior, the notion of prospect-based emotions plays an important role: recent literature suggests that emotional states of such agents should not only be triggered by present stimuli, but also by anticipation on future stimuli, and evaluation of past stimuli in the context of these anticipations. Within the current study, an extension of the belief-desire-intention (BDI) model with prospect-based emotions is proposed, and is evaluated with respect to its capabilities of enhancing believability of game characters. The model has been implemented in the modeling language LEADSTO. In addition, a game application has been developed, in which a user can play a two games (tic-tac-toe and a game of dice) against an agent that is equipped with the emotion-based model.

These impressions are important to manage because they can impact users' perception of the agent and their willingness to continue the interaction with the agent. The model aims at detecting user's impression of the agent and producing appropriate agent's verbal and nonverbal behaviours in order to maintain a positive impression of warmth and competence. User's impressions are recognized using a machine learning approach with facial expressions (action units) which are important indicators of users' affective states and intentions. The agent adapts in real-time its verbal and nonverbal behaviour, with a reinforcement learning algorithm that takes user's impressions as reward to select the most appropriate combination of verbal and non-verbal behaviour to perform. A user study to test the model in a contextualized interaction with users is also presented. Our hypotheses are that users' ratings differs when the agents adapts its behaviour according to our reinforcement learning algorithm, compared to when the agent does not adapt its behaviour to user's reactions (i.e., when it randomly selects its behaviours). The study shows a general tendency for the agent to perform better when using our model than in the random condition. Significant results shows that user's ratings about agent's warmth are influenced by their a-priori about virtual characters, as well as that users' judged the agent as more competent when it adapted its behaviour compared to random condition.  2019 IEEE.",2019,,,,,234-240,,10.1109/ACII.2019.8925495,,#1922,Biancardi 2019,,

(2) How important is it that emotional expressions are added in a way that is consistent with the content of the message, in animated agents? To address these questions, a positively framed healthy eating message was created which was variously presented via GRETA, a matched human actor, GRETA's voice only (no face) or as text only. Furthermore, versions of GRETA were created which displayed additional emotional facial expressions in a way that was either consistent or inconsistent with the content of the message. Overall, it was found that although GRETA received significantly higher ratings for helpfulness and likeability, presenting the message via GRETA led to the poorest memory performance among users. Importantly, however, when GRETA's additional emotional expressions were consistent with the content of the verbal message, the negative effect on memory performance disappeared. Overall, the findings point to the importance of achieving consistency in animated agents.

Results indicated that the main effects of agent facial expression and gesture as well as the interaction were significant for agent perception and learning. With regard to learning, for attitudinal instruction, participants learned more when the agent’s facial expression was present but deictic gesture was absent; however, for procedural instruction, students learned more when the agent’s gestures were present.

In this paper, we analyze which factors influence the believability of the agent acting as the software assistant. We consider several factors such as embodiment, communicative behavior, and emotional capabilities. We conduct a perceptive study where we analyze the role of plausible and/or appropriate emotional displays in relation to believability. We also investigate how people judge the believability of the agent, and whether it provokes social reactions of humans toward it. Finally, we evaluate the respective impact of embodiment and emotion over believability judgments. The results of our study show that (a) appropriate emotions lead to higher perceived believability, (b) the notion of believability is closely correlated with the two major socio-cognitive variables, namely competence and warmth, and (c) considering an agent as believable can be different from having a human-like attitude toward it.

Previous research investigated the influence of gaze by manipulating mutual eye contact. Therefore, gaze and body direction have been changed as a whole, resulting in only congruent gaze and body directions (averted or directed) of another person. Here, we aimed to disentangle these effects by using short animated sequences of virtual agents posing with either direct or averted body or gaze. Attention allocation by means of eye movements, facial muscle response, and emotional experience to agents of different gender and facial expressions were investigated. Eye movement data revealed longer fixation durations, i.e., a stronger allocation of attention, when gaze and body direction were not congruent with each other or when both were directed towards the observer. This suggests that direct interaction as well as incongruous signals increase the demands of attentional resources in the observer. For the facial muscle response, only the reaction of muscle zygomaticus major revealed an effect of body direction, expressed by stronger activity in response to happy expressions for direct compared to averted gaze when the virtual character's body was directed towards the observer. Finally, body direction also influenced the emotional experience ratings towards happy expressions.

Each participant's gaze was recorded in an inter-personal interactive patient surveillance simulation. Results suggest that conversational and passive animations elicited visual attention in a similar manner, as compared to the no animation condition. Results also suggest that when participants face critical situations in inter-personal medical simulations, visual attention towards the virtual human decreases while gaze towards goal directed activities increases. © 2018 IEEE.",2018,,"25th IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces, VR 2018",,,25-32,,10.1109/VR.2018.8446364,,#14856,Volonte 2018,,

In this paper we systematically compare four modes of gaze transmission: (1) natural gaze, (2) hybrid gaze, which combines natural gaze transmission with a social gaze model, (3) synthesized gaze, which combines a random gaze transmission with a social gaze model, and (4) purely random gaze. Investigating dyadic interactions, results show a linear trend for the perception of virtual rapport, trust, and interpersonal attraction, suggesting that these measures increase with higher naturalness and social adequateness of the transmission mode.

Gaze and proxemic behaviors of the agents are manipulated dynamically while the participants’ gaze and proxemic responses are being measured. As could be expected, participants showed strongest gaze and proxemic responses when agents manipulated both at the same time. However, agents that only manipulated gaze elicited weaker responses compared to agents that only manipulated proxemics.

To do so, a computational model is proposed that embraces explicit intentions in the agents that are aimed at increasing the other's relations towards them. The model is inspired in the notion of emotional intelligence, and allows for agents to reason about the emotions of others and perform interpersonal emotion regulation (IER) in order to dynamically create the relations with others. The model was used to build the NPCs of a computer game scenario in NeverWinter Nights 2, where the player is required to work together with two agents to achieve a particular quest. An experiment was then conducted where players interacted with either a version with or without IER. By measuring friendship quality we were able to show that when one of the agents employed IER strategies it was perceived as more friendly according to four out of six dimensions of friendship.

We created a mixed reality medical team training exercise designed to impact communication behaviors that are critical for patient safety. We recruited anesthesia residents to go through an operating room training exercise with MRHs to assess and influence residents' closed loop communication behaviors during medication administration. We manipulated the behavior of the MRHs to determine if the MRHs could influence the residents' closed loop communication behavior. Our results showed that residents' closed loop communications behaviors were influenced by MRHs. Additionally, we found there was a statistically significant difference between groups based on which MRH behavior residents observed.

Utilizing a multimodal virtual reality, we investigated whether touch and smile promoted compliance to a virtual agent's requests and whether receiver's personality modulated the effects. Compliance was measured using the ultimatum game, in which participants were asked to either reject or accept an agent's monetary offers. Decision-making data were accompanied by offer-related cardiac responses, both of which were analyzed as a function of expression (anger, neutral, and happiness), touch (visuo-tactile, visual, no touch), and three personality traits: behavioral inhibition/activation system sensitivity (BIS/BAS) and justice sensitivity. People accepted unfair offers more often if the agents smiled or touched them. The effect of touch was more enhanced in those with low justice sensitivity and BAS, whereas facial expressions affected those with high BIS the most. Unfair offers amplified the cardiac response, but this effect was not dependent on nonverbal cues.

Feedback from participants also revealed detailed insights into their perceptions of the agents and highlighted a strong preference for the emotionally expressive version. Design implications for embodied agents are discussed and future research areas identified. © 2012 British Informatics Society Limited.

221,Trusting digital chameleons: The effect of mimicry by a virtual social agent on user trust,"Verberne, F.M.F.; Ham, J.; Ponnada, A.; Midden, C.J.H.","Earlier research suggested that mimicry increases liking and trust in other people. Because people respond socially to technology and mimicry leads to increased liking of virtual agents, we expected that a mimicking virtual agent would be liked and trusted more than a non-mimicking one. We investigated this expectation in an automotive setting. We performed an experiment in which participants played an investment game and a route planner game, to measure their behavioral trust in two virtual agents. These agents either mimicked participant's head movements or not. Liking and trust of these virtual agents were measured with questionnaires. Results suggested that for the investment game, mimicry did not increase liking or trust. For the route planner game however, a mimicking virtual agent was liked and trusted more than a non-mimicking virtual agent. These results suggest that mimicry could be a useful tool to persuade users to trust a virtual agent. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",2013,,"8th International Conference on Persuasive Technology, PERSUASIVE 2013",7822 LNCS,,234,,,,#18964,Verberne 2013,,
222,Comprehension and engagement in survey interviews with virtual agents,"Conrad, F.G.; Schober, M.F.; Jans, M.; Orlowski, R.A.; Nielsen, D.; Levenstein, R.","This study investigates how an onscreen virtual agent's dialog capability and facial animation affect survey respondents' comprehension and engagement in ""face-to-face"" interviews, using questions from US government surveys whose results have far-reaching impact on national policies. In the study, 73 laboratory participants were randomly assigned to respond in one of four interviewing conditions, in which the virtual agent had either high or low dialog capability (implemented through Wizard of Oz) and high or low facial animation, based on motion capture from a human interviewer. Respondents, whose faces were visible to the Wizard (and videorecorded) during the interviews, answered 12 questions about housing, employment, and purchases on the basis of fictional scenarios designed to allow measurement of comprehension accuracy, defined as the fit between responses and US government definitions. Respondents answered more accurately with the high-dialog-capability agents, requesting clarification more often particularly for ambiguous scenarios; and they generally treated the high-dialog-capability interviewers more socially, looking at the interviewer more and judging high-dialog-capability agents as more personal and less distant. Greater interviewer facial animation did not affect response accuracy, but it led to more displays of engagement-acknowledgments (verbal and visual) and smiles-and to the virtual interviewer's being rated as less natural. The pattern of results suggests that a virtual agent's dialog capability and facial animation differently affect survey respondents' experience of interviews, behavioral displays, and comprehension, and thus the accuracy of their responses. The pattern of results also suggests design considerations for building survey interviewing agents, which may differ depending on the kinds of survey questions (sensitive or not) that are asked. © 2015 Conrad, Schober, Jans, Orlowski, Nielsen and Levenstein.",2015,,Front.

223,"Uncanny…but convincing? Inconsistency between a virtual agent's facial proportions and vocal realism reduces its credibility and attractiveness, but not its persuasive success","Stein, J.-P.; Ohler, P.","Embodied agents-i.e. digital systems represented by a virtual or robotic body-are used as persuasive tools in many different contexts. Still, psychological research indicates that for an agent to successfully influence its audience, many design factors have to work together to create a likable and trustworthy impression. Tapping into literature on the uncanny valley phenomenon, which has received only little attention in the field of persuasion research, we advance a consistency perspective that proposes matching levels of modality realism as a main requirement for users' acceptance. In an online experiment, we invite 107 participants to watch the persuasive speech of a virtual agent, manipulating both its facial proportions and vocal realism in a 2 × 2 between-subject design. Indeed, a mismatch between the realism of both features significantly reduces the agent's perceived credibility and attractiveness; yet, we observe that neither manipulation actually influences persuasive success in terms of attitude change. A potential explanation for this result pattern is offered by the Elaboration Likelihood Model, assuming that participants focused more on the agent's message than on peripheral cues to adjust their attitudes. © The Author(s) 2018.",2018,,Interact Comput.,30,6,480-491,,10.1093/iwc/iwy023,,#22153,Stein 2018,,

Animated scenarios are designed with 3D virtual agents in order to test 3 conditions: In the ""still"" condition, the narrative content was accompanied by emotional facial expressions without any body movements; in the ""idle"" condition, emotionally neutral body movements were introduced; and in the ""congruent"" condition, emotional body postures congruent with the character's facial expressions were displayed. Those conditions were examined by 27 subjects, and their impact on the viewers' attentional and emotional processes was assessed. The results highlight the importance of the contextual information to emotion recognition and irony interpretation.

226,Conversations with a virtual human: Synthetic emotions and human responses,"Qu, Chao; Brinkman, Willem-Paul; Ling, Yun; Wiggers, Pascal; Heynderickx, Ingrid","To test whether synthetic emotions expressed by a virtual human elicit positive or negative emotions in a human conversation partner and affect satisfaction towards the conversation, an experiment was conducted where the emotions of a virtual human were manipulated during both the listening and speaking phase of the dialogue. Twenty-four participants were recruited and were asked to have a real conversation with the virtual human on six different topics. For each topic the virtual human’s emotions in the listening and speaking phase were different, including positive, neutral and negative emotions. The results support our hypotheses that (1) negative compared to positive synthetic emotions expressed by a virtual human can elicit a more negative emotional state in a human conversation partner, (2) synthetic emotions expressed in the speaking phase have more impact on a human conversation partner than emotions expressed in the listening phase, (3) humans with less speaking confidence also experience a conversation with a virtual human as less positive, and (4) random positive or negative emotions of a virtual human have a negative effect on the satisfaction with the conversation. These findings have practical implications for the treatment of social anxiety as they allow therapists to control the anxiety evoking stimuli, i.e., the expressed emotion of a virtual human in a virtual reality exposure environment of a simulated conversation.

Users were immersed in a virtual room via a head mounted display (HMD). Their full-body movements were tracked and mapped to respective movements of their avatars. Embodiment was induced by presenting the users' avatars to themselves in a virtual mirror. Afterwards they had to react to a non-verbal behavior of a virtual interaction partner they encountered in the virtual space. Several measures were taken to analyze the effect of the appearance of the users' avatars as well as the effect of the appearance of the others' avatars on the users. The realistic avatars were rated significantly more human-like when used as avatars for the others and evoked a stronger acceptance in terms of virtual body ownership (VBO).

This UV theory was first hypothesized by robotics professor Masahiro Mori in the 1970's [Mori 1970] but is still taken seriously today by movie and game developers as it can stop audiences feeling emotionally engaged in their stories or games. It has been speculated that this is due to audiences feeling a lack of empathy towards the characters. With the increase in popularity of interactive drama video games (such as L.A. Noire or Heavy Rain), delivering realistic conversing virtual characters has now become very important in the real-time domain. Video game rendering techniques have advanced to a very high quality; however, most games still use linear blend skinning due to the speed of computation. This causes a mismatch between the realism of the appearance and animation, which can result in an uncanny character. Many game developers opt for a stylised rendering (such as cel-shading) to avoid the uncanny effect [Thompson 2004]. In this preliminary work, we begin to study the complex interaction between rendering style and perceived trust, in order to provide guidelines for developers for creating plausible virtual characters.",2010,,"ACM SIGGRAPH ASIA 2010 Sketches, SA'10",,,,,10.1145/1899950.1899991,,#28313,McDonnell 2010,,

Despite the importance of this aspect of human-human relationships, few intelligent systems have tried to build user models of trust, credibility, or other similar interpersonal variables, or to influence these variables during interaction with users. Humans use a variety of kinds of social language, including small talk, to establish collaborative trusting interpersonal relationships. We argue that such strategies can also be used by intelligent agents, and that embodied conversational agents are ideally suited for this task given the myriad multimodal cues available to them for managing conversation. In this article we describe a model of the relationship between social language and interpersonal relationships, a new kind of discourse planner that is capable of generating social language to achieve interpersonal goals, and an actual implementation in an embodied conversational agent.

In a 22 between subjects design each behavior was varied in two levels: occurrence of the behavior compared to the absence of the behavior. Results show that self-touching gestures compared to no self-touching gestures have positive effects on the experiences and evaluations of the user, whereas eyebrow raising evoked less positive experiences and evaluations in contrast to no eyebrow raising.

Participants played with an agent that copied their smiles and frowns or one that showed the opposite pattern – i.e., that frowned when they smiled. As people tend to smile more than frown, we independently manipulated the contingency of expressions to ensure any effects are due to mimicry alone, and not the overall positivity/negativity of the agent: i.e., participants saw either a reflection of their own expressions or saw the expressions shown to a previous participant. Results show that participants smiled significantly more when playing an agent that mimicked them. Results also show a complex association between smiling, feelings of rapport, and cooperation.

In our study, participants played a tabletop game with a VH, in which each player takes a turn and moves their own token along the designated spots on the shared table. We compared two conditions as follows: the VH in the virtual condition moves a virtual token that can only be seen through AR glasses, while the VH in the physical condition moves a physical token as the participants do; therefore the VH’s token can be seen even in the periphery of the AR glasses. For the physical condition, we designed an actuator system underneath the table. The actuator moves a magnet under the table which then moves the VH’s physical token over the surface of the table. Our results indicate that participants felt higher co-presence with the VH in the physical condition, and participants assessed the VH as a more physical entity compared to the VH in the virtual condition. We further observed transference effects when participants attributed the VH’s ability to move physical objects to other elements in the real world. Also, the VH’s physical influence improved participants’ overall experience with the VH. We discuss potential explanations for the findings and implications for future shared AR tabletop setups. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",2018,,"24th ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology, VRST 2018",,,,,10.1145/3281505.3281533,,#21987,Lee 2018,,
243,Blended agents: Manipulation of physical objects within mixed reality environments and beyond,"Schmidt, S.; Ariza, O.; Steinicke, F.","Mixed reality (MR) environments allow real users and virtual agents to coexist within the same virtually augmented physical space. While tracking of different body parts such as the user's head and hands allows virtual objects to show plausible reactions to actions of the real user, virtual agents only have a very limited influence on their physical environment. In this paper, we introduce the concept of blended agents, which are capable of manipulations of physical properties related to the object's location and surface material. We present two prototypic implementations of virtual-physical interactions using robotic actuators and thermochromic ink. As both interactions show considerably different characteristics, e.g., with regard to their persistence, explicability, and observability, we performed a user study to investigate their effects on subjective measures such as the agent's perceived social and spatial presence. In the context of a golf scenario, participants were interacting with a blended agent that was capable of virtual-physical manipulations such as hitting a golf ball and writing on physical paper. A statistical analysis of quantitative data did not yield any significant differences between blended agents and VAs without physical capabilities. However, qualitative feedback of the participants indicates that persistent manipulations improve both the perceived realism of the agent and the overall user experience. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",2019,,"7th ACM Symposium on Spatial User Interaction, SUI 2019",,,,,10.1145/3357251.3357591,,#22794,Schmidt 2019,,
244,Is photorealism important for perception of expressive virtual humans in virtual reality?,"Zibrek, K.; Martin, S.; McDonnell, R.","In recent years, the quality of real-time rendering has reached new heights—realistic reflections, physically based materials, and photometric lighting are all becoming commonplace in modern game engines and even interactive virtual environments, such as virtual reality (VR). As the strive for realism continues, there is a need to investigate the effect of photorealism on users’ perception, particularly for interactive, emotional scenarios in VR. In this article, we explored three main topics, where we predicted photorealism will make a difference: the illusion of being present with the virtual person and in an environment, altered emotional response toward the character, and a subtler response—comfort of being in close proximity to the character. We present a perceptual experiment, with an interactive expressive virtual character in VR, which was designed to induce particular social responses in people. Our participant pool was large (N = 797) and diverse in terms of demographics. We designed a between-group experiment, where each group saw either the realistic rendering or one of our stylized conditions (simple and sketch style), expressing one of three attitudes: Friendly, Unfriendly, or Sad. While the render style did not particularly effect the level of comfort with the character or increase the illusion of presence with it, our main finding shows that the photorealistic character changed the emotional responses of participants, compared to the stylized versions. We also found a preference for realism in VR, reflected in the affinity and higher place illusion in the scenario, rendered in the realistic render style. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",2019,,ACM Trans.

245,Exploring the effects of observed physicality conflicts on real-virtual human interaction in augmented reality,"Kim, K.; Bruder, G.; Welch, G.","Augmented reality (AR) enables the illusion of computer-generated virtual objects and humans co-existing with us in the real world. Virtual humans (VHs) in AR can further induce an illusion of physicality in the real world due to their form of presentation and their behavior, such as showing awareness of their surroundings. However, certain behaviors can cause a conflict that breaks this illusion, for example, when we see a VH passing through a physical object. In this paper we describe a human-subject study that we performed to test the hypothesis that participants experience higher copresence in conflict-free circumstances, and we investigate the magnitude of this effect and behavioral manifestations. Participants perceived a social situation in a room that they shared with a VH as seen through a HoloLens head-mounted display. The behavior of the VH either caused conflicts with (occupied the same space as) physical entities, or avoided them. Our results show that the conflicts in physicality significantly reduced subjective reports of copresence. Moreover, we observed that participants were more likely to cause a conflict (occupy the same space as) virtual entities in case the VH had avoided the conflict. We discuss implications for future research and shared AR setups with real-virtual human interactions. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.",2017,,"23rd ACM Conference on Virtual Reality Software and Technology, VRST 2017",Part F131944,,,,10.1145/3139131.3139151,,#21055,Kim 2017,,
246,Generative Model of Agent’s Behaviors in Human-Agent Interaction,"Dermouche, Soumia; Pelachaud, Catherine","A social interaction implies a social exchange between two or more persons, where they adapt and adjust their behaviors in response to their interaction partners. With the growing interest in human-agent interactions, it is desirable to make these interactions more natural and human like. In this context, we aim at enhancing the quality of the interaction between user and Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA) by endowing ECA with the capacity to adapt its behavior in real time according the user’s behavior. The novelty of our approach is to model the agent’s nonverbal behaviors as a function of both agent’s and user’s behaviors jointly with the agent’s communicative intentions creating a dynamic loop between both interactants. Moreover, we encompass the variation of behavior over time through a LSTM-based model. Our model IL-LSTM (Interaction Loop LSTM) predicts the next agent’s behavior taking into account the behavior that both, the agent and the user, have displayed within a time window. We have conducted an evaluation study involving an agent interacting with visitors in a science museum. Results of our study show that participants have better experience and are more engaged in the interaction when the agent adapts its behaviors to theirs, thus creating an interactive loop.",2019,,,,,375-384,,10.1145/3340555.3353758,,#532,Dermouche 2019,,
247,The effects of speech-gesture cooperation in animated agents' behavior in multimedia presentations,"Buisine, Stephanie; Martin, Jean-Claude","Until now, research on arrangement of verbal and non-verbal information in multimedia presentations has not considered multimodal behavior of animated agents. In this paper, we will present an experiment exploring the effects of different types of speech-gesture cooperation in agents' behavior: redundancy (gestures duplicate pieces of information conveyed by speech), complementarity (distribution of information across speech and gestures) and a control condition in which gesture does not convey semantic information. Using a Latin-square design, these strategies were attributed to agents of different appearances to present different objects. Fifty-four male and 54 female users attended three short presentations performed by the agents, recalled the content of presentations and evaluated both the presentations and the agents. Although speech-gesture cooperation was not consciously perceived, it proved to influence users' recall performance and subjective evaluations: redundancy increased verbal information recall, ratings of the quality of explanation, and expressiveness of agents. Redundancy also resulted in higher likeability scores for the agents and a more positive perception of their personality. Users' gender had no influence on this set of results.  2007.",2007,,Interacting with Computers,19,4,484-493,,10.1016/j.intcom.2007.04.002,,#1085,Buisine 2007,,

249,"The doctor's digital double: How warmth, competence, and animation promote adherence intention","Dai, Z.; MacDorman, K.F.","Background: Each year, patient nonadherence to treatment advice costs the US healthcare system more than $300 billion and results in 250,000 deaths. Developing virtual consultations to promote adherence could improve public health while cutting healthcare costs and usage. However, inconsistencies in the realism of computer-animated humans may cause them to appear eerie, a phenomenon termed the uncanny valley. Eeriness could reduce a virtual doctor's credibility and patients' adherence. Methods: In a 2 × 2 × 2 between-groups posttest-only experiment, 738 participants played the role of a patient in a hypothetical virtual consultation with a doctor. The consultation varied in the doctor's Character (good or poor bedside manner), Outcome (received a fellowship or sued for malpractice), and Depiction (a recorded video of a real human actor or of his 3D computer-animated double). Character, Outcome, and Depiction were designed to manipulate the doctor's level of warmth, competence, and realism, respectively. Results: Warmth and competence increased adherence intention and consultation enjoyment, but realism did not. On the contrary, the computer-animated doctor increased adherence intention and consultation enjoyment significantly more than the doctor portrayed by a human actor. We propose that enjoyment of the animated consultation caused the doctor to appear warmer and more real, compensating for his realism inconsistency. Expressed as a path model, this explanation fit the data. Discussion: The acceptance and effectiveness of the animation should encourage the development of virtual consultations, which have advantages over creating content with human actors including ease of scenario revision, internationalization, localization, personalization, and web distribution. © 2018 Dai and MacDorman.",2018,,PeerJ Comput.

250,What makes virtual agents believable?,"Bogdanovych, A.; Trescak, T.; Simoff, S.","ABSTRACT: In this paper we investigate the concept of believability and make an attempt to isolate individual characteristics (features) that contribute to making virtual characters believable. As the result of this investigation we have produced a formalisation of believability and based on this formalisation built a computational framework focused on simulation of believable virtual agents that possess the identified features. In order to test whether the identified features are, in fact, responsible for agents being perceived as more believable, we have conducted a user study. In this study we tested user reactions towards the virtual characters that were created for a simulation of aboriginal inhabitants of a particular area of Sydney, Australia in 1770 A.D. The participants of our user study were exposed to short simulated scenes, in which virtual agents performed some behaviour in two different ways (while possessing a certain aspect of believability vs. not possessing it). The results of the study indicate that virtual agents that appear resource bounded, are aware of their environment, own interaction capabilities and their state in the world, agents that can adapt to changes in the environment and exist in correct social context are those that are being perceived as more believable. Further in the paper we discuss these and other believability features and provide a quantitative analysis of the level of contribution for each such feature to the overall perceived believability of a virtual agent. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",2016,,Connect.

251,Hand Gesture and Mathematics Learning: Lessons From an Avatar,"Cook, S.W.; Friedman, H.S.; Duggan, K.A.; Cui, J.; Popescu, V.","A beneficial effect of gesture on learning has been demonstrated in multiple domains, including mathematics, science, and foreign language vocabulary. However, because gesture is known to co-vary with other non-verbal behaviors, including eye gaze and prosody along with face, lip, and body movements, it is possible the beneficial effect of gesture is instead attributable to these other behaviors. We used a computer-generated animated pedagogical agent to control both verbal and non-verbal behavior. Children viewed lessons on mathematical equivalence in which an avatar either gestured or did not gesture, while eye gaze, head position, and lip movements remained identical across gesture conditions. Children who observed the gesturing avatar learned more, and they solved problems more quickly. Moreover, those children who learned were more likely to transfer and generalize their knowledge. These findings provide converging evidence that gesture facilitates math learning, and they reveal the potential for using technology to study non-verbal behavior in controlled experiments.

As a multimodal phenomenon, previous research argued that a mismatch in the expressive channels provides evidence of joint audio-video emotional processing. However, while previous work studied this from the point of view of emotion recognition and processing, not much is known about what effect a multimodal agent would have on a human-agent interaction task. Also, agent appearance could influence this interaction too. Here we manipulated the agent’s multimodal emotional expression (""smiling face"" and ""smiling voice"", or both) and agent type (photorealistic or cartoon-like virtual human) and assessed people’s trust toward this agent. We measured trust using a mixed-methods approach, combining behavioural data from a survival task, questionnaire ratings and qualitative comments. These methods gave different results: while people commented on the importance of emotional expressivity in the agent’s voice, this factor had limited influence on trusting behaviours; while people rated the cartoon-like agent on several traits higher than the photorealistic one, the agent’s style also was not the most influential feature on people’s trusting behaviour. These results highlight the contribution of a mixed-methods approach in human-machine interaction, as both explicit and implicit perception and behaviour will contribute to the success of the interaction. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

263,"Exploring the affective, motivational and cognitive effects of pedagogical agent enthusiasm in a multimedia learning environment","Liew, Tze Wei; Mat Zin, Nor Azan; Sahari, Noraidah","In a traditional classroom environment, instructor enthusiasm has been shown to enhance student’s emotion, affective perceptions, intrinsic motivation, and cognitive outcome. Additionally, emotional response theory argues that enthusiastic verbal and nonverbal cues of an instructor will induce positive emotional states in learners, which in turn, enact learners’ approach behaviours in the learning process. Therefore, should a pedagogical agent convey enthusiastic behaviours in a multimedia learning environment? Literature and theoretical reviews offer two competing views. The first view, based on emotional response theory, predicts that enthusiastic verbal and nonverbal cues of a pedagogical agent can induce higher positive emotions in learners, which in turn, enhance affective perceptions, intrinsic motivation, and cognitive outcome. However, the second view, based on cognitive load theory, suggests that pedagogical agent enthusiasm may increase extraneous cognitive load (additional processing in the mind), which negatively impact emotion, affective perceptions, intrinsic motivation, and cognitive outcome. To investigate the effects of agent enthusiasm, seventy-two university freshmen interacted with either an enthusiastic agent or a neutral agent (operationalized through vocal tones, facial expression, gestures, and remarks) that simulates the instructional role of a virtual tutor that delivers narrative demonstrations on how to predict the outputs of C-Programming algorithms. The results of our study showed that pedagogical agent enthusiasm significantly enhanced emotion, intrinsic motivation, affective perceptions, and cognitive outcome. Moreover, mediation analyses revealed that the facilitating effects of agent enthusiasm on intrinsic motivation, affective perceptions of the learning environment, and affective perceptions of the pedagogical agent were fully mediated by a learner’s positive emotion, thus demonstrating that the framework of emotional response theory can be applied to learner-agent interaction in a multimedia learning environment.

Thus, 2D female virtual agents with four different realism appearance namely realistic, semi-realistic, stylized and cartoon-like were designed and developed. Thus, quasi experimental design was used to answer the research questions derived from this study. The data obtained from the experiment was analysed using ANOVA, post hoc and bootstrap mediation analysis. A number of 600 Electrical Engineering students were chosen from seven polytechnics in Malaysia as respondents in the experiment. From the research it was found that cartoon-like design obtained the lowest mean score arousal followed by stylized, realistic and semi-realistic designs. However, cartoon-like design scored highest mean score for emotions in learning followed by semi-realistic, realistic and stylized designs. Therefore, cartoon-like agent is the best agent among others in inducing positive emotions in learning. In addition, the mediation analysis shows that arousal has mediating effects on relation between different realism designs and emotions in learning. In conclusion, this study recommends cartoon-like agent as the best suitable design for 2D virtual agent followed by semi-realistic, realistic and stylized designs subsequently.

A theory called the 'Uncanny Valley' has been used to describe the phenomenon that the appearance of a virtual character can contribute to negative/positive audience reactions to that character [Mori 1970]. Since the style used to render a character strongly changes the appearance, we investigate whether a difference in render style can indirectly influence audience reaction, which we measure based on perception of personality. Based on psychology research, we first scripted original character dialogues in order to convey a range of ten typical personality types. Then, a professional actor was recruited to act out these dialogues, while his face and body motion and audio were recorded. The performances were mapped onto a virtual character rendered in two styles that differ in appearance: an appealing cartoon style and unappealing ill style (Figure 1). In our experiment, participants were asked questions about the character's personality in order for us to test if the difference in render style causes differences in personality perception. Our results found an indirect effect of render style where the cartoon style was rated as having a more agreeable personality than the ill style. This result has implications for developers interested in creating appealing virtual humans, avoiding the 'Uncanny Valley' phenomenon. © 2014 ACM.",2014,,"11th ACM Symposium on Applied Perception, SAP 2014",,,111-115,,10.1145/2628257.2628270,,#30697,Zibrek 2014,Andrew Leeds (2022-02-16 17:16:08)(Select): Interaction minimal; participants reviewed 10 video clips.; ,

In a 2 (input modality: voice control vs. remote controller) X 2(agent type: realistic vs. cartoonlike agent) between-subjects experiment, participants (N = 64) used and evaluated a smart TV in an educational context. Results revealed negative effects of voice control, especially when it accompanied a cartoonlike agent. Those who used the voice control to the cartoonlike agent rated the agentless humanlike, attractive, intelligent and intimate than did those who used the remote controller to the cartoonlike agent. Also, those who used voice control reported that watching the TV was less involving and enjoyable than those who used the remote controller. The negative effects were mitigated, however, when they interacted with a realistic agent.

We instead focus on embodied conversational agents (ECAs). ECAs occupy the virtual environment as interactive partners. We propose that the ECA analogues of immersion and presence are physicality and social presence. We performed a study to determine the effect of an ECA's physicality on social presence and eliciting realistic behavior from the user. The results showed that increasing physicality can elicit realistic behavior and increase social presence but there was also an interaction effect with plausibility.  2012 IEEE.,2012,,,,,19-22,,10.1109/VR.2012.6180871,,#1398,Chuah 2012,"Sharon Mozgai (2022-03-05 07:38:38)(Select): I want to argue that a virtual agent's background is part of the virtual agent.

Research studies have shown that innocent humor increases likeability, boosts trust, reduces tension, encourages creativity and improves teamwork. In this paper, we present a study focusing on deploying humor in interaction with a virtual agent. 25 participants evaluated the logs of conversations exchanged between a human user and two virtual agents acting as tour guides. Even though answers were equal in terms of content delivered, one agent used humorous statements to respond the queries while the other agent presented the content in a neutral way. To create answers with a humorous effect we combined information extracted from various websites focusing on tourist fun facts, pun and jokes collections. Results showed that our manipulation was successful, i.e. the humorous agent was indeed perceived as being significantly funnier. Additionally, the agent was perceived as delivering more interesting answers as compared with its counterpart. Further, participants showed statistically significant preferences towards the humorous agent when asked to choose between the agents. As such, we believe that using humor in interaction with virtual agents increases the agent likeability and possibly contributes towards a better user experience. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2019.",2019,,"9th International Workshop on Spoken Dialogue System Technology, IWSDS 2018",579,,285,,,,#22536,Niculescu 2019,"Andrew Leeds (2022-02-16 17:55:08)(Select): Borderline inclusion as the ""humor"" of the dialogue could be considered more as fidelity in the area of cultural awareness, or conversely, more as a characteristic of personality.; ",

We explore the systematic manipulation of animation quality, speech quality, and rendering style, and its impact on the perceptions of virtual agents in terms of naturalness, engagement, trust, credibility, and persuasion within a health counseling domain. The agent's counseling behavior was based on live video footage of a human counselor. We conducted a between-subjects study that had 12 conditions. Character animation was varied between a static image, procedural animation using a gestuary, and manually rotoscoped animation. Voice quality was varied between recorded audio of the human counselor and synthetic speech. Character rendering style was varied between 3D-shaded realistic and toon-shaded. Prior studies indicate that people prefer and attribute more sociality to other people and agents when modalities are consistent in their level of quality. Thus, we hypothesize that people will be most affected by agents whose animation, voice, and rendering style are consistent, rather than the effects of channel quality being purely additive. Results indicate that natural animations and recorded voice are more appropriate for general acceptance, trust, and credibility of the agent, and how appropriate she seems for the task. However, our results indicate that for a brief health counseling task, animation might actually be distracting from the persuasive message, with the highest levels of persuasion found when the amount of agent animation is minimized.",2020,,,,,1010-1018,,,,#33,Parmar 2020,,

We present an interactive eye gaze model for embodied conversational agents in order to improve the experience of users participating in Interactive Storytelling. The underlying narrative in which the approach was tested is based on a classical XIXth century psychological novel: Madame Bovary, by Flaubert. At various stages of the narrative, the user can address the main character or respond to her using free-style spoken natural language input, impersonating her lover. An eye tracker was connected to enable the interactive gaze model to respond to user's current gaze (i.e. looking into the virtual character's eyes or not). We conducted a study with 19 students where we compared our interactive eye gaze model with a non-interactive eye gaze model that was informed by studies of human gaze behaviors, but had no information on where the user was looking.

Our goal is to close this gap by presenting the results of a controlled user study in a CAVE. 27 participants were immersed in a small-scale office with the task of reaching the office door. Their way was blocked either by a male or female VA, representing their co-worker. The VA showed different behavioral patterns regarding gaze and locomotion.

In modeling primary emotions we follow the idea of ""Core Affect"" in combination with a continuous progression of bodily feeling in three-dimensional emotion space (PAD space), that is subsequently categorized into discrete emotions. In humans, primary emotions are understood as onto-genetically earlier emotions, which directly influence facial expressions. Secondary emotions, in contrast, afford the ability to reason about current events in the light of experiences and expectations. By technically representing aspects of each secondary emotion's connotative meaning in PAD space, we not only assure their mood-congruent elicitation, but also combine them with facial expressions, that are concurrently driven by primary emotions.

276,Exploring avatar facial fidelity and emotional expressions on observer perception of the uncanny valley,"Bailey, J.; Blackmore, K.; Robinson, G.","Avatars or digital human characters are traditionally associated with digital games, where they enhance story-based interaction and player engagement. However, interest in accurate and cost-effective avatar development has increased in fields such as serious gaming and simulation training. The interest from these fields stems from training needs where avatars, used create human emotional experiences, could aid in appropriate education. In this context, the area of avatar emotional expression is not well understood. Applications often result in avatars that produce feelings of uncanniness in end-users, which may have a negative impact on training outcomes. This paper aims to firstly explore how avatar fidelity or realism could influence the emotional experience of interactions between end users and virtual humans. Secondly, we examine how avatar facial features displaying emotional expressions affect participants perceived valence of the avatar. These affects were assessed through a combination of experimental and survey methodologies. An existing ‘Godspeed’ survey was used to measure an end-users’ perception of an avatars ‘humanness’, ‘eeriness’, and ‘attractiveness,’ together with a three-part experiment that measured participants’ startle reflex responses to avatars with differing fidelity and emotional expressions. The results indicated that participant gender played a role in their perception of avatars. Also, the gender of the avatar appeared to have a significant impact on participant responses. Avatars displaying sad expressions emerged as less unpleasant and possibly less uncanny than smiling expressions.

In the present experiment, we sought to further investigate the potential effects of humor for virtual agents. Subjects played the iterated prisoner's dilemma with a virtual agent that was intended to be funny or not. Additionally, we manipulated cooperativeness of the agent. First, although humor did not increase cooperation among subjects, our results indicate that humor modulates how cooperation is perceived in an agent.

279,''It doesn't matter what you are!'' Explaining social effects of agents and avatars,"von der Putten, A.M.; Kramer, N.C.; Gratch, J.; Sin-Hwa Kang","Empirical studies have repeatedly shown that autonomous artificial entities, so-called embodied conversational agents, elicit social behavior on the part of the human interlocutor. Various theoretical approaches have tried to explain this phenomenon: According to the Threshold Model of Social Influence (Blascovich et al., 2002), the social influence of real persons who are represented by avatars will always be high, whereas the influence of an artificial entity depends on the realism of its behavior. Conversely, the Ethopoeia concept (Nass  Moon, 2000) predicts that automatic social reactions are triggered by situations as soon as they include social cues. The presented study evaluates whether participants belief in interacting with either an avatar (a virtual representation of a human) or an agent (autonomous virtual person) lead to different social effects. We used a 22 design with two levels of agency (agent or avatar) and two levels of behavioral realism (showing feedback behavior versus showing no behavior). We found that the belief of interacting with either an avatar or an agent barely resulted in differences with regard to the evaluation of the virtual character or behavioral reactions, whereas higher behavioral realism affected both.

We model the effects of an English-speaking digital character with different accents on human interactants (i.e., users). Our cultural influence model proposes that paralinguistic realism, in the form of accented speech, is effective in promoting culturally congruent cognition only when it is self-relevant to users. For example, a Chinese or Middle Eastern English accent may be perceived as foreign to individuals who do not share the same ethnic cultural background with members of those cultures. However, for individuals who are familiar and affiliate with those cultures (i.e., in-group members who are bicultural), accent not only serves as a motif of shared social identity, it also primes them to adopt culturally appropriate interpretive frames that influence their decision making.",2017,,AI & Society,32,1,16-Sep,,http://dx.doi.org.libproxy1.usc.edu/10.1007/s00146-014-0568-1,,#2372,Khooshabeh 2017,,

We empirically evaluated the effects of near visually realistic vs. non-realistic stylized appearance of virtual humans on the emotional response of participants in a medical virtual reality system that was designed to educate users in recognizing the signs and symptoms of patient deterioration. In a between-subjects experiment protocol, participants interacted with one of three different appearances of a virtual patient, namely visually realistic, cartoon-shaded and charcoal-sketch like conditions in a mixed reality simulation. Emotional impact were measured via a combination of quantitative objective measures were gathered using skin Electrodermal Activity (EDA) sensors, and quantitative subjective measures such as the Differential Emotion Survey (DES IV), Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), and Social Presence questionnaire. The emotional states of the participants were analyzed across four distinct time steps during which the medical condition of the virtual patient deteriorated (an emotionally stressful interaction), and were contrasted to a baseline affective state. Objective EDA results showed that in all three conditions, male participants exhibited greater levels of arousal as compared to female participants. We found that negative affect levels were significantly lower in the visually realistic condition, as compared to the stylized appearance conditions. Furthermore, in emotional dimensions of interest-excitement, surprise, anger, fear and guilt participants in all conditions responded similarly. However, in social emotional constructs of shyness, presence, perceived personality, and enjoyment-joy, we found that participants responded differently in the visually realistic condition as compared to the cartoon and sketch conditions.

Building on these results, we aimed to 1) test the hypothesis that exposure to fear-related odorant would affect impression formation through fear contagion and 2) verify whether these effects can be observed in an ecologically valid (i.e., virtual) environment. We proposed that exposure to fear-related odorant would cause receivers to feel more anxious, which in turn would lead them to report less trust toward an unknown virtual character. This study had 2 distinct phases. First, we collected perspiration odorants from the armpits of 12 male senders (i.e., the source of the odorant) during the viewing of either fear or joy inducing film clips. In the second phase, 53 women receivers were exposed to either a fear, joy, or neutral odorant (i.e., between-subjects design) by breathing through a gauze attached to a disposable respirator mask while immersed in a virtual bar. As expected, receivers exposed to fear odorants felt significantly more stressed. Mediation analysis also revealed an indirect effect of exposure on trust through anxiety. More specifically, the more anxious the receiver felt, the less she trusted the virtual character.

287,"Being Touched by a Virtual Human. Relationships between Heart Rate, Gender, Social Status, and Compliance.","Swidrak, J.; Pochwatko, G.","Interpersonal touch remains one of the most puzzling and challenging aspects of communication in virtual reality. A brief touch can be used to influence one's behavior. Our study aimed to analyze the influence of an agent's touch on men's compliance and its psychophysiological correlates. Additionally, we asked whether social cues such as aspect, stereotypically related to masculinity/femininity and social status, modify that effectiveness. To answer these questions, we built an immersive version of the classic decision-making game Ultimatum in which a proposer offers how to split 10 coins and a responder decides whether to accept it or not. In our experiment, we used the game to observe whether men are more compliant to the agent if the offer was preceded by a touch, compared to two control conditions: no stimulus and a buzz. In two experiments, male participants played with four agents each, differing in gender and levels of stereotypically seen masculinity (study 1) and social status (study 2). Before the proposer made an offer, he/she could take additional action, namely, to send a sound (short buzz) or touch the participant. The key factor in securing compliance was the value of the offer made by the agent the more generous the offer, the higher the chances for its acceptance. Surprisingly, even though the manipulation of the agent's characteristics was successful in both studies, neither touch nor the agent's gender influenced compliance in men.

It can show pleasure, mask
embarrassment or even act as an indicator of in-group belonging. A laughing agent can modify the perception of
funniness a user has of an event, compared to a smiling
agent [4]. Endowing machines with laughter capabilities is
still a crucial challenge to develop virtual agents and robots
able to act as companions, coaches, or supporters in a more
natural manner. In this work, we follow the paradigm introduced by previous scholars on copying behaviors ([2]) and
we extend it to allow for copying expressivity on the fly,
that is copying the expressivity dynamically as it evolves in
human’s performance. Our aim is to study how a virtual
agent able to copy and to adapt its laughing and expressive
behaviors on the fly participates in enhancing user’s experience in the interaction. We present an experiment in which
a human participant listens to audio stimuli in the presence
of a laughing agent performing scripted Vs. copying expressivity. More precisely, in our setup: the agent always laughs
at pre-defined moments which are linked to the audio stimulus playback; the agent’s quality of movement (direction
and amplitude of laughter movements) can be modulated
on-the-fly depending on user’s quality of movement (copying condition) or not (scripted condition).; ",
289,Virtual peacemakers: Mimicry increases empathy in simulated contact with virtual outgroup members,"Hasler, B.S.; Hirschberger, G.; Shani-Sherman, T.; Friedman, D.A.","This research examined virtual-human interactions as a new form of simulated contact between members of groups in conflict. A virtual human representing an outgroup member (a Palestinian) interacted with 60 Jewish Israeli participants in an experimental study. We manipulated postural mimicry by the virtual interaction partner during a conversation about a sensitive conflict issue. Mimicry increased empathy toward the Palestinians, irrespective of participants' feelings toward the Palestinians prior to the experiment. Further, mimicked participants who reported a priori negative feelings toward Palestinians expressed more sympathy toward their Palestinian virtual interaction partner, rated themselves as closer to him, and perceived the interaction as more harmonious compared to participants in a counter-mimicry condition. The results underscore the impact of mimicry on intergroup interactions, especially on individuals who harbor negative feelings toward the outgroup. The use of virtual-human interactions in obtaining this effect reveals the still widely unexplored potential of technology-enhanced conflict resolution. © Copyright 2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2014.",2014,,Cyberpsychol.

In the second phase, we assessed the effect of breathing on the users perceptions of rapport and naturalness. The study had a within-subjects design, with breathing/not-breathing as the independent variable.

This subject was examined across four experimental conditions where participants interacted with three different types of agents and a real human. The three types of agents included the Non-Contingent Agent, the Responsive Agent (opposite to the Non-Contingent Agent), and the Mediated Agent (controlled by a real human). The results indicated that people having greater social anxiety would feel less rapport and show worse performance while feeling more embarrassment if they experience the untimely feedback of the Non-Contingent Agent. The results also showed people having more anxiety would trust real humans less as their interaction partners. We discuss the implication of this relationship between social anxiety in a human subject and the interactional fidelity of an agent on the design of virtual characters for social skills training and therapy.

The facilitation of human-machine communication and cooperation is of growing importance as smartphones, autonomous cars, or social robots increasingly pervade human social spaces. Previous research has shown that emotionally expressive virtual characters generally elicit higher cooperation and trust than 'neutral' ones. Since emotional expressions are multi-modal, and given that virtual characters can be designed to our liking in all their components, would a mismatch in the emotion expressed in the face and voice influence people's cooperation with a virtual character? We developed a game where people had to cooperate with a virtual character in order to survive on the moon. The character's face and voice were designed to either smile or not, resulting in 4 conditions: smiling voice and face, neutral voice and face, smiling voice only (neutral face), smiling face only (neutral voice). The experiment was set up in a museum over the course of several weeks; we report preliminary results from over 500 visitors, showing that people tend to trust the virtual character in the mismatched condition with the smiling face and neutral voice more.

Besides their appearance and behavior, appropriate speech is required for them to be perceived as human-like and realistic. Additionally to the used voice signal, also its auralization in the immersive virtual environment has to be believable. Therefore, we investigated the effect of adding directivity to the speech sound source. Directivity simulates the orientation dependent auralization with regard to the agent's head orientation. We performed a one-factorial user study with two levels (n=35) to investigate the effect directivity has on the perceived social presence and realism of the agent's voice. Our results do not indicate any significant effects regarding directivity on both variables covered.

This paradigm has not been extended to semantic learning, or to an adult population before. Thus, the present study used a virtual reminiscing agent to investigate the effect of elaborative and non-elaborative reminiscing on students' semantic memory recall of a virtual event to investigate this reminiscing paradigm. A study involving ninety-eight undergraduate psychology students revealed that participants exposed to highly elaborative reminiscing free recalled significantly more correct information than low elaborative reminiscing (closed-ended questions and low detail), and no reminiscing. Second, open-ended questions were superior to closed-ended questions in free recall memory, as well as in number of memory errors. Lastly, the provision of high detail improved recall when combined with open-ended questions, but not when combined with closed-ended questions.

These perceptions are significant, as they influence people's behavior towards the agents, and may foster or inhibit repeated interactions between them. In this paper we investigate whether computer agents can use the expression of emotion to influence human perceptions of trustworthiness. In particular, we study human-computer interactions within the context of a negotiation game, in which players make alternating offers to decide on how to divide a set of resources. A series of negotiation games between a human and several agents is then followed by a ""trust game."" In this game people have to choose one among several agents to interact with, as well as how much of their resources they will trust to it. Our results indicate that, among those agents that displayed emotion, those whose expression was in accord with their actions (strategy) during the negotiation game were generally preferred as partners in the trust game over those whose emotion expressions and actions did not mesh. Moreover, we observed that when emotion does not carry useful new information, it fails to strongly influence human decision-making behavior in a negotiation setting.

311,Does character’s visual style affect viewer’s perception of signing avatars?,"Adamo-Villani, N.; Lestina, J.; Anasingaraju, S.","The paper reports a study that aimed to determine whether character’s visual style has an effect on how signing avatars are perceived by viewers. The stimuli of the study were two polygonal characters that presented two different visual styles: stylized and realistic. Each character signed four sentences. Forty-seven participants with experience in American Sign Language (ASL) viewed the animated signing clips in random order via web survey. They (1) identified the signed sentences (if recognizable), (2) rated their legibility, and (3) rated the appeal of the signing avatar. Findings show that while character’s visual style does not have an effect on subjects’ perceived legibility of the signs and sign recognition, it has an effect on their interest in the character. The stylized signing avatar was perceived as more appealing than the realistic one. © Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2016.",2016,,"2nd International Conference on E-Learning, E-Education, and Online Training, eLEOT 2015",160,,1,,,,#14749,Adamo-Villani 2016,,
312,On-demand virtual health counselor for delivering behavior-change health interventions,"Amini, Reza; Lisetti, Christine; Yasavur, Ugan; Rishe, Naphtali","In this paper, we discuss a novel approach for the computer-delivery of Brief Motivational Interventions (BMIs) for health behavior change. We describe the basic elements of our system architecture, and focus on enabling a multimodal Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA) to deliver the health behavior change interventions empathetically by adapting, in real-time, its verbal and non-verbal communication messages to those of its clients. The designed empathy model integrates a cognitive component and an affective components. We then discuss the evaluation experiment that we designed and conducted to evaluate the impact of empathy model on users' experience with the empathic character. Results indicate that, in comparison with the non-empathic counselor, the empathic one is better accepted (e.g., more enjoyable, empathizing, engaging, and likable) and some users might be willing to disclose more private information (e.g., drinking habits) to the counselor endowed with empathic abilities than the one without.  2013 IEEE.",2013,,,,,46-55,,10.1109/ICHI.2013.13,,#1386,Amini 2013,,
313,A human-like embodied agent learning tour guide for e-learning systems,"Hasegawa, Dai; Ugurlu, Yucel; Sakuta, Hiroshi","E-learners have to study independently without educators, making it difficult for them to maintain interest or motivation. This study proposes the use of a human-like, embodied conversational agent in an e-learning system to interactively guide users through content and subsequently improve efficacy. Additionally, we investigate the effect of the agent's posture on users' a) learning motivation, b) engagement, c) perception of the agent, and d) learning efficacy. Forty-one undergraduate students participated in our empirical study, which revealed that through the use of human-like postures learners' learning motivation and engagement increased.  2014 IEEE.",2014,,,,,50-53,,10.1109/EDUCON.2014.6826067,,#1453,Hasegawa 2014,,
314,Verbal empathy and explanation to encourage behaviour change intention,"Abdulrahman, A.; Richards, D.; Ranjbartabar, H.; Mascarenhas, S.","Inspired by the role of therapist-patient relationship in fostering behaviour change, agent-human relationship has been an active research area. This trusted relationship could be a result of the agent’s behavioural cues or the content it delivers that shows its knowledge. However, the impact of the resulting relationship using the various strategies on behaviour change is understudied. In this paper, we investigate the role of two strategies (empathic and social dialogue and explanation) in building agent-user rapport and whether the level of behaviour change intentions are due to the use of empathy or to trusting the agent’s understanding and recommendations through explanation. Hence, we designed two versions of a virtual advisor, empathic and neutral, to reduce study stress among university students and measured students’ rapport levels and intentions to change their behaviour. Some recommended behaviours had explanations based on the user’s beliefs. Our results showed that the agent could build a trusting relationship with the user with the help of the explanation regardless of the level of rapport. The results further showed that nearly all of the recommendations provided by the agent highly significantly increased the intention of the user to change their behavior related to these recommendations. However, we also found that it is important for the agent to obtain and reason about the user’s intentions concerning the specific behaviour before recommending a certain behavior change. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG part of Springer Nature.",2021,,J.

We empirically evaluated the effects of realistic vs. non-realistic rendering of virtual humans on the emotional response of participants in a medical virtual reality system that was designed to educate users to recognize the signs and symptoms of patient deterioration. In a between-subjects experiment protocol, participants interacted with one of three different appearances of a virtual patient, namely realistic, non-realistic cartoon-shaded and charcoal-sketch like conditions. Emotional impact of the rendering conditions was measured via a combination of subjective and objective metrics. © 2015 IEEE.",2015,,"IEEE Virtual Reality Conference, VR 2015",,,163-164,,10.1109/VR.2015.7223346,,#31016,Chaturvedi 2015,,
316,Belief-based Agent Explanations to Encourage Behaviour Change,"Abdulrahman, A.; Richards, D.; Ranjbartar, H.; Mascarenhas, S.","Explainable virtual agents provide insight into the agent's decision-making process, which aims to improve the user's acceptance of the agent's actions or recommendations. However, explainable agents commonly rely on their own knowledge and goals in providing explanations, rather than the beliefs, plans or goals of the user. Little is known about the user perception of such tailored explanations and their impact on their behaviour change. In this paper, we explore the role of belief-based explanation by proposing a user-Aware explainable agent by embedding the cognitive agent architecture with a user model and explanation engine to provide a tailored explanation. To make a clear conclusion on the role of explanation in behaviour change intentions, we investigated whether the level of behaviour change intentions is due to building agent-user rapport through the use of empathic language or due to trusting the agent's understanding through providing explanation. Hence, we designed two versions of a virtual advisor agent, empathic and neutral, to reduce study stress among university students and measured students' rapport levels and intentions to change their behaviour. Our results showed that the agent could build a trusted relationship with the user with the help of the explanation regardless of the level of rapport. The results, further, showed that nearly all the recommendations provided by the agent highly significantly increased the intention of the user to change their behavior. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",2019,,"19th ACM International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents, IVA 2019",,,176-178,,10.1145/3308532.3329444,,#22384,Abdulrahman 2019,,
317,Emotionally responsive virtual counselor for behavior-change health interventions,"Amini, Reza; Lisetti, Christine; Yasavur, Ugan","In this paper, we discuss a novel approach to design an emotionally responsive system in the context of virtual health interventions for behavior change. We describe the system's design with a focus on enabling a multimodal Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA) to deliver the interventions empathetically. This is done by adapting its verbal and non-verbal behavior, in real-time, to those of the clients. Our current approach is based on a successful existing patient-centered intervention for behavior change - the Drinker's Check-Up (DCU). Although, the DCU uses a text-only web interface, it has been reported to reduce alcohol consumption in problem drinkers. We discuss the results of users' evaluation of the DCU intervention compared to the same intervention delivered with empathic and non-empathic ECAs. Results show that, the empathic virtual counselor has better acceptance than the other two systems.  2014 Springer International Publishing.",2014,,,8463 LNCS,,433-437,,10.1007/978-3-319-06701-8_40,,#1388,Amini 2014,,
